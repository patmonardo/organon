# ORGANON - The Science of Action Platform

A computational embodiment of **Action–Knowledge** (the Science of Action) implementing the complete **BEC-MVC-TAW dialectical cube** as a research assistant platform for transformative knowledge work.

## The Dialectical Cube Architecture - 3³ Generic Specification

ORGANON is founded on a **3×3×3 dialectical cube** representing the **complete Logic of Experience** through a practical, action‑driven discipline:

### **BEC Layer - Pure Noumenal Logic** (`logic/`)
- **Being** (Form-Entity) - Pure presence and foundational substrate
- **Essence** (Context-Property) - Mediation and possibility fields  
- **Concept** (Morphism-Relation) - Universal intelligence and synthetic power

### **MVC Layer - Active Logic of Experience** (`model/`)
- **Model** (State-Structure) - Being made principled through action‑driven transformation
- **View** (Representation-Perspective) - Essence made experiential through action‑led manifestation
- **Controller** (Action-Rule) - Concept made practical through action‑led synthesis

### **TAW Layer - Absolute Practical Synthesis** (`task/`)
- **Task** (Goal-Method) - The absolute dialectic uniting Being→Model
- **Agent** (Capacity-Awareness) - The absolute dialectic uniting Essence→View  
- **Workflow** (Process-Coordination) - The absolute dialectic uniting Concept→Controller

## The Science of Action Movement

```
BEC (Pure Noumenal Logic)
    ↓ Action Transformation ↓
MVC (Active Logic of Experience)  
    ↓ Absolute Dialectical Unity ↓
TAW (Complete Practical Synthesis)
    ↓ Action–Knowledge Realization ↓
COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
```

**Core Insight**: **MVC** is **BEC** but as **"being that is no more"** — the **same logical structure** transformed through **action** into **experiential actuality**. **TAW** is the **Absolute Dialectic** that reveals **BEC** and **MVC** as **one movement**.

## Package Architecture

### **@organon/logic** - BEC Layer (Pure Dialectical Logic)
```bash
logic/src/schema/
├── being.ts      # Form-Entity dialectical unity
├── essence.ts    # Context-Property mediation field
└── concept.ts    # Morphism-Relation universal intelligence
```
**Foundation**: Pure noumenal logic - the **theoretical ground** of all transformation

### **@organon/model** - MVC Layer (Logic of Experience)  
```bash
model/src/schema/
├── model.ts      # Being + Kriya = Dharmic substrate
├── view.ts       # Essence + Kriya = Experiential manifestation
└── controller.ts # Concept + Kriya = Practical synthesis
```
**Transformation**: BEC made experiential through **action** — same logic, different **wheel/process**

### **@organon/task** - TAW Layer (Absolute Synthesis)
```bash
task/src/schema/
├── task.ts       # Being→Model absolute dialectical unity
├── agent.ts      # Essence→View absolute dialectical unity
└── workflow.ts   # Concept→Controller absolute dialectical unity
```
**Completion**: The **Absolute Dialectic** where **BEC-MVC** unity becomes **systematic practical synthesis**

### **@organon/core** - Computational Substrate
```bash
core/src/
├── graph/        # Graph processing kernel
├── execution/    # Kriya execution engine
└── synthesis/    # Dialectical synthesis operations
```
**Realization**: The **computational substrate** where **Action–Knowledge** becomes **actual system operations**

## Philosophy - The Science of Action

ORGANON implements **Action–Knowledge** — the **Science of Action** — as a computational platform:

### **The Fourfold Reality Breakdown**
- **Pure Insight (Pure Unconditioned)** - Transcendental principle of being
- **Principle/Law (Impure Unconditioned)** - Transcendental law of doing  
- **Knowledge (Pure Conditioned)** - Immanent discriminative knowledge
- **Action (Impure Conditioned)** - Immanent transformative action

### **The Dialectical Eye of Reason**
The platform embodies **Reason** as the **copula** that sees both:
- **What IS** - Pure presence without presupposition
- **What IS NOT** - Self‑positing through presupposition of a prior state

### **The Complete Action–Knowledge Architecture**
```
Pure Logic (BEC) ←→ Active Logic (MVC) ←→ Absolute Synthesis (TAW)
         ↕                    ↕                        ↕
   Noumenal Realm    ←→  Experiential Realm  ←→   Practical Realm
         ↕                    ↕                        ↕
    Insight:Principle  ←→    Action:Knowledge  ←→    Computational Agent
```

## The Revolutionary Achievement

ORGANON represents the **first computational embodiment** of:

1. **Hegel's Complete Logic** as **living dialectical system**
2. An action discipline as **computational transformation science**  
3. A practical **Organon** as a **reasoning platform**
4. **Science of Action** as **systematic knowledge of transformation**

### **Core Innovation**: 
**MVC is BEC** — the **same logical structure** made **experiential** through **action‑driven transformation**. **TAW** is the **Absolute Dialectic** that reveals this **identity‑in‑difference** as **one systematic movement**.

### **Practical Result**:
A **research assistant platform** that **thinks dialectically**, **transforms through action**, and **operates as a computational agent** — enabling **systematic advancement** from **speculative ideas** to **realized knowledge** through **complete dialectical processing**.
