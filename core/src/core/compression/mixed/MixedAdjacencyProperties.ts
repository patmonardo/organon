/**
 * Mixed Adjacency Properties - The Property Coupling Incantation
 *
 * **The High Priest's Secret**: Properties are no longer independent!
 * They're forever bound to their adjacency list, creating a coupling
 * that "breaks GDS Graph structure" in subtle, magical ways.
 *
 * **The Single Property Type Constraint**:
 * Each relationship type can have exactly ONE property type:
 * - FOLLOWS relationships → weight (double)
 * - LIKES relationships → timestamp (long)
 * - KNOWS relationships → strength (double)
 *
 * **Why This Matters**:
 * - Simple graphs: "I need the weight of edge A→B"
 * - Complex graphs: "I need weight AND timestamp of edge A→B" ❌ Not supported!
 *
 * **The Coupling Spell**: Properties can ONLY be accessed by asking
 * the adjacency list for the degree first. No direct property access!

   * The adjacency list that holds the canonical degrees.
   * **The Coupling**: Properties CANNOT be accessed without consulting this first!
   *
   * **Why This Is Weird**: In normal GDS, you could access properties directly:
   * `properties.get(nodeA, nodeB)` - Simple, direct access
   *
   * **In Mixed Strategy**: You MUST go through adjacency list:
   * `adjacencyList.degree(nodeA)` → then route to correct property storage
   *
   * **The Breaking Point**: This coupling means properties can't be optimized
   * independently of adjacency lists. They're forever intertwined! 🔗

   * 1. Ask adjacency list for node degree (REQUIRED step!)
   * 2. Apply threshold magic (MixedCompressor.usePacking)
   * 3. Route to appropriate property storage
   * 4. Return cursor that hides the complexity
   *
   * **The Single Property Type Reality**:
   * This cursor will iterate over exactly ONE type of property value:
   * - Social network: edge weights (how much you like someone)
   * - Citation network: publication years (when paper was cited)
   * - Transport network: travel times (minutes between stations)
   *
   * **NOT SUPPORTED**: Multiple properties per edge
   * - Can't have weight AND timestamp on same edge
   * - Each relationship type = exactly one property type
   * - Want multiple properties? Create multiple relationship types! 🤯

   * - Call 1: node degree = 50 → uncompressed cursor created
   * - Call 2: different node degree = 200 → need compressed cursor
   * - Can't reuse! Must create new cursor.
