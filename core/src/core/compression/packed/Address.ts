/**
 * Address - Off-Heap Memory Pointer for Packed Compression
 *
 * **The Foundation**: This is what enables packed compression to transcend
 * JavaScript's heap limitations. By storing compressed data in off-heap
 * memory, we can achieve massive graphs without GC pressure.
 *
 * **Memory Safety**: Prevents the classic C bugs - use after free,
 * double free, memory leaks. This is systems programming in TypeScript!
 *
 * **Atomic Operations**: Thread-safe memory management using atomic
 * compare-and-swap operations. Multiple graph algorithms can safely
 * share compressed data.
 *
 * **The Transcendence**: This is where graph databases meet systems
 * programming. Raw memory pointers managed safely in high-level code!
 */

/**
 * An address to some off-heap memory for packed compression.
 *
 * **Off-Heap Strategy**: Store compressed adjacency lists outside the

 *
 * **Memory Model**:
 * - address: 64-bit pointer to off-heap memory block
 * - bytes: Size of the allocated block
 * - Atomic operations for thread safety
 *
 * **Use Cases**:
 * - Social networks with billions of edges
 * - Knowledge graphs with massive connectivity
