# Concept Glossary (Universal • Particular • Singular)

## Universal
### Pure concept: absolutely infinite, unconditioned; genesis via being → essence → concept
Pure concept = absolutely infinite, unconditioned. Genesis: being → essence → concept via self-repulsion; positedness/positing sublate to original being. Concept = mutual penetration of positing and immanent turning-back; pure reflection as infinite, self-referring determinateness.
- id: con-univ-1-genesis-and-absoluteness
- tags: Concept: absolutely-infinite, Concept: unconditioned, Concept: infinite-self-referring-determinateness
- HLOs: Define pure concept: absolutely infinite, unconditioned; genesis via self-repulsion

### Concept self-identity; universality as negation of negation
Concept = absolute self-identity as negation of negation. Universality = pure self-reference through negativity; simplest yet contains maximal difference via absolute negativity.
- id: con-univ-2-universality-negation-of-negation
- tags: Universality: contains-difference-by-absolute-negativity
- HLOs: Universality as pure self-reference (negation of negation)

### Contrast with Being; universal as simple yet rich, identity as absolute mediation
Being: simple immediacy that vanishes into its opposite (becoming). Universal: simple yet rich; identity that is absolute mediation (not something mediated).
- id: con-univ-3-contrast-with-being-richness
- tags: —
- HLOs: Contrast Being and Universal; identity as absolute mediation

### Abstract universal, double negation, and not-yet externality
Abstract universal arises by leaving-aside determinations (double negation already present), but is misrepresented as external. The universal has not yet externality; it remains absolute negativity (negation of negation).
- id: con-univ-4-abstract-universal-and-externality
- tags: LeavingAside: further-negating, Universal: absolute-negativity
- HLOs: Abstract universal via leaving-aside; double negation present; no externality yet

### Universal maintains itself in its determination; persistence vs qualitative perishing
Universal is not restricted by its determination; unlike qualitative being it persists as the soul of the concrete, self-identical through becoming.
- id: con-univ-5-preserves-in-determination
- tags: Universal: soul-of-concrete
- HLOs: Universal maintains positive self-identity within determination

### Not mere reflective shine; universal as essence and creative principle
Universal is the essence and positive nature of its determinations; as absolute negativity it is creative mediation, not mere reflective shine or formless substance.
- id: con-univ-6-essence-creative-principle
- tags: Concept: informing-creative-principle
- HLOs: Universal as essence and creative mediation (not mere reflective shine)

### Universal as free power/love; rest in its other
Universal relates to its other as to itself: free power, free love, rest-in-other as return-to-self.
- id: con-univ-7-free-power-love
- tags: Universal: free-power, Universal: free-love
- HLOs: Free power/love: rest in its other as in its own

### Determinateness within the universal; totality vs abstract universal
Universal inherently contains particularity and singularity (via absolute negativity); as totality it is concrete content. “Abstract universal” is an isolated, untrue moment.
- id: con-univ-8-determinateness-totality-abstract
- tags: Universal: totality-of-concept, Universal: concrete-with-own-content
- HLOs: Universal contains P and S; totality of concept vs abstract universal

### Universal as total reflection: outward and inward shining; determinate concept as immanent character
Universal's determinateness is double reflection (outward/inward). As inward-shining, determinateness is the immanent character (genus), equal in extension with universality; determinate concept remains infinitely free.
- id: con-univ-9-total-reflection-inward-outward
- tags: Determinateness: genus-immanent-character, DeterminateConcept: infinitely-free
- HLOs: Double reflection (outward/inward); genus as immanent character; freedom of determinate concept

### Higher universal: outward turned inward; life, I, spirit as concretes; idea of infinite spirit
Truly higher universal redirects outwardness inward (second negation). Life, I, spirit, absolute concept are concretes with self-complete determinacies; their resolution is the idea of infinite spirit.
- id: con-univ-10-higher-universal-and-concretes
- tags: Determinateness: positedness/reflective-shine, Concretes: Life|I|Spirit|AbsoluteConcept
- HLOs: Truly higher universal = outward turned inward (second negation); concretes → idea of infinite spirit

### True infinite universal as particularity: creative self-differentiation; universal differences
True infinite universal freely particularizes as creative, self-referring negativity; it internally posits differences that are themselves universals (self-referring), fixing isolated differences.
- id: con-univ-11-true-infinite-universal-creative-differentiation
- tags: Universal: creative-power, Differences: fixed-isolated
- HLOs: Creative self-differentiation; posit universal differences

### Finite subsistence as universality; the concept's creativity
Finite being-for-itself (thinghood/substance) is in truth universality—the form the infinite concept gives its differences. This is the concept's inner creativity.
- id: con-univ-12-finite-as-universal-form-creativity-of-concept
- tags: Concept: inner-creativity
- HLOs: Finite being-for-itself = universality as form; inner creativity of the concept

## Particular
### Particularity: determinateness of the concept; immanent to the universal
Particularity = determinateness of the concept; not an external limit. It is the universal’s own immanent moment (universal with itself in it).
- id: con-part-1-immanent-determinateness
- tags: —
- HLOs: Define particularity as immanent determinateness (not external limit)

### Particular contains universality; diversity as universal totality
Particulars share and exhibit the same universality; their diversity is universal as totality. If taken as mere diversity, totality appears as completeness to be exhausted.
- id: con-part-2-universality-as-substance-totality
- tags: Diversity: universal-totality
- HLOs: Diversity of particulars as universal totality; sphere to exhaust

### Completeness without inner standard; universality as external reflex
“Completeness” (counting species) lacks an inner standard; universality appears merely as an external reflex, yielding contingent completeness.
- id: con-part-3-contingent-completeness
- tags: Completeness: contingent
- HLOs: Completeness without inner principle; universality as external reflex

### From diversity to opposition; particularity as intrinsic totality and principle
Beyond mere diversity: opposition = immanent connection. Particularity (as universality) is intrinsic totality and essential principle; its determinateness is only what the universal posits.
- id: con-part-4-particularity-as-immanent-connection
- tags: Particularity: essential-principle
- HLOs: Particularity as intrinsic totality and essential principle

### Universal self-determines as particular; species as (a) universal (b) particular
Universal differentiates only from itself: becomes the particular. Species: (a) universal itself, (b) particular. The universal overreaches its opposite and remains with itself—principle of its own diversity.
- id: con-part-5-self-determination-of-universal
- tags: —
- HLOs: Universal self-determines as particular; species schema (U, P)

### True logical division: two coordinated particulars; one negativity
Division: concept as indeterminate U makes itself P; the two sides are coordinated particulars, subordinated to U, yet that U is also a side. Their opposition = one determinateness: simple negativity in the universal.
- id: con-part-6-true-logical-division
- tags: BothSides: particular-and-coordinated
- HLOs: True logical division: two coordinated particulars; one simple negativity

### Difference in its truth: from limit/relative to concept-unity; one determinate concept
Difference in truth = concept-unity. Earlier (being/reflection) differences are limit/relative. Whole–part, cause–effect, etc. are one determinate (simple) concept when grasped in unity.
- id: con-part-7-difference-in-concept
- tags: Causality: simple-concept
- HLOs: Difference as concept-unity; cause/effect as one simple concept

### Completeness of particularity; impotence of nature; concept’s absolute power
Particularity complete in U–P difference; nature’s many species = self-external manifoldness (no inner standard). Concept as absolute power lets differences go free—mere abstract side of nothingness.
- id: con-part-8-completeness-and-nature
- tags: Nature: self-externality; impotent-for-rigor, Manifoldness: abstract-side-of-nothingness
- HLOs: Completeness via U–P; nature’s impotence; concept’s freedom of differences

### Mediated immediacy; abstract universality as form; determinateness as content
Determinate concept = mediated immediacy (equal-to-itself via absolute mediation). In it, universality is form; determinateness is content—abstract universality as its clothing.
- id: con-part-9-abstract-universality-form-content
- tags: Determinateness: simple-principle-and-moment-of-totality, AbstractUniversality: form-of-determinate-concept
- HLOs: Determinate concept as mediated immediacy; universality=form, determinateness=content

### Particularity as determinate universality; abstract universal = U, D, immediate unity (no posited mediation)
Particularity = determinate universality. Abstract universal contains U, determinateness, and their immediate unity; mediation is only conditional (not posited) → “unconceptualized concept.”
- id: con-part-10-determinate-universality-and-abc
- tags: Particularity: determinate-universality, AbstractUniversal: unconceptualized-concept
- HLOs: Abstract universal = U + determinateness + immediate unity; mediation not posited

### Understanding’s abstract universal; limits; absolute substance still abstract; abstraction not empty
“Concept” is often taken as abstract universal (faculty of understanding). This method stays within finitude/necessity/negative-infinite. Absolute substance lacks absolute form (still abstract). Abstraction isn’t empty; naming indeterminateness makes it determinate—exposing the concept and its truth.
- id: con-part-11-understanding-and-abstraction-limits
- tags: Understanding: faculty-of-abstract-universal
- HLOs: Understanding’s range; absolute substance still abstract; abstraction has content

### Empty determinate concepts vs principled differentiation; absolute determinateness as true content
A determinate concept without totality/principle of differentiation is empty—even with concrete content. True content = absolute determinateness (the concept’s own difference).
- id: con-part-12-empty-vs-principled-concepts
- tags: AbsoluteDeterminateness: true-content-in-concept-element
- HLOs: Empty determinate concepts vs principled differentiation; absolute determinateness as true content

## Singular
### Singularity already posited through particularity
Singularity flows from particularity: determinate universality → self-referring determinateness.
- id: con-sing-1-from-particularity
- tags: Particularity: determinate-universality→self-referring-determinateness
- HLOs: Singularity posited through particularity

### Self-mediation; inward/outward shine; false abstraction vs true singularity
Singularity = self-mediation (negation of negation). Inward/outward shine: abstraction climbs to empty genera (false), while true singularity is the depth where concept posits itself.
- id: con-sing-2-self-mediation-and-false-abstraction
- tags: Singularity: self-mediation/absolute-negativity
- HLOs: Self-mediation; inward/outward shine; abstraction vs singularity

### U and P as total concept; abstraction excludes singularity
U and P are the total concept; in S they are what they are in-and-for-themselves. Abstraction drops determinateness and excludes singularity, yielding lifeless universals.
- id: con-sing-3-universal-particular-total-concept
- tags: Abstraction: excludes-singularity→void-of-concept
- HLOs: U and P as total concept; abstraction void of concept

### Abstraction’s products are singulars; concrete unity appears
Abstraction isolates determinations and yields singular products (content/form split), yet these are concrete unities of singular content and abstract universality.
- id: con-sing-4-abstraction-produces-singulars
- tags: Products: singular-and-concrete
- HLOs: Abstraction isolates; its products are singular yet concrete

### Particular is also singular (and vice versa); three particular determinations
P ↔ S as determinate universals. If kept abstract, concept has three particular determinations (U, P, S).
- id: con-sing-5-particular-equals-singular
- tags: —
- HLOs: Particular = singular as determinate universal; three determinations counted

### Particularity as totality (concretion) and as immediate unity (middle term)
Treating S as one determination: particularity = embracing totality (concretion), also immediate unity (as determinate universality) → middle term of formal syllogism.
- id: con-sing-6-particularity-as-totality-middle-term
- tags: Particularity: embracing-totality/concretion
- HLOs: Particularity as embracing totality and middle term

### Every distinction dissolves; counting (quantity) is inappropriate
Determinations dissolve into each other; only representational thinking isolates and “counts” U/P/S. Quantitative distinction is misplaced here.
- id: con-sing-7-dissolution-of-distinctions
- tags: Counting: inappropriate-here
- HLOs: Determinational dissolution; counting is inappropriate

### S as negation of negation: each determination is totality
S posits inseparability: as negation of negation, it grounds opposition in unity. Each distinct determination is the totality; determinateness is the whole concept.
- id: con-sing-8-negation-of-negation-totality
- tags: Singularity: negation-of-negation
- HLOs: Negation of negation: each determination is the whole concept

### Singularity externalizes the concept into actuality; posited abstraction fixes difference
Singularity makes the concept actual: as immanent abstraction it concretizes U and P into content; fixes difference as determinate determinateness (posited abstraction).
- id: con-sing-9-externalization-actuality
- tags: Singularity: determinate-determinateness/posited-abstraction
- HLOs: Singularity externalizes concept to actuality; fixes difference as determinate determinateness

### Singular as qualitative “this”: exclusivity; lowest view of universal as commonality
Singular = qualitative this: repulsion presupposes many; exclusive toward others. Universal taken as mere commonality of indifferent singulars is the lowest, external view.
- id: con-sing-10-this-exclusion-commonality
- tags: Singular: qualitative-this
- HLOs: Singular as qualitative this: exclusivity; universal-as-commonality is lowest view

### “This” as posited immediacy (pointing-at) vs singular as mediated-immediate within itself
“This” is posited immediacy via external pointing. The singular is also a this, but its mediation is internal: self-separating abstraction that is simultaneously positive connection.
- id: con-sing-11-this-vs-singular-mediation
- tags: Singular: repelling-separation + positive-connection
- HLOs: “This” needs external pointing; singular internalizes mediation

### Singularity posits self-subsisting differences; essential relation (not mere plurality)
Singularity posits self-subsisting differences in essential relation (not mere plurality). It excludes the universal yet refers to it as an essential moment.
- id: con-sing-12-posited-differences-essential-relation
- tags: —
- HLOs: Singularity posits self-subsisting differences; essential relation; excludes-yet-refers to U

### Concept loses posited unity; determinate becomes totality; singularity posited as judgment
Self-subsistent determinations mean the concept loses its posited unity; the determinate becomes totality. Turning-back as singularity = absolute, originative partition → judgment.
- id: con-sing-13-judgment-emergence
- tags: Determinations: self-subsistent/in-and-for-themselves, Singularity: absolute-originative-partition, Result: Judgment
- HLOs: Concept loses posited unity; determinate→totality; turning-back as originative partition = judgment
