The Leibnizian monad develops its representations from itself

For essence is what stands on its own:
it exists as self-mediating through a negation which it itself is.
It is, therefore, the identical unit of absolute negativity and immediacy.
The negativity is negativity in itself;
it is its reference to itself and thus immediacy in itself.
But it is negative reference to itself,
a self-repelling negating;

the negative or the determinate over against the negativity.
But this determinateness is itself absolute negativity

equally is just determinateness and moment,
negativity solely referring to itself.

being both the leftover of being.
But these two, and no less the
distinction of essence from them,
consist solely in this:
that essence is taken at first as an immediate,
not as it is in itself,
namely as an immediacy which is immediacy
as pure mediacy or absolute negativity.
This first immediacy is thus only the determinateness of immediacy.
The sublating of this determinateness of essence consists, therefore,
in nothing further than showing that the unessential is only shine,
and that essence rather contains this shine within itself.
For essence is an infinite self-contained movement
which determines its immediacy as negativity
and its negativity as immediacy,
and is thus the shining of itself within itself.
In this, in its self-movement,
essence is reflection.`,
