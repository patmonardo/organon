The in-itself, in which the something is
reflected into itself from its being-for-other,
no longer is an abstract in-itself
but, as the negation of its being-for-other,
is mediated through this latter,
which is thus its moment.
It is not only the immediate identity of
the something with itself,
but the identity by virtue of which
the something also has present in it
what it is in itself;
the being-for-other is present in it
because the in-itself is the sublation of it,
is in itself from it;
but, because it is still abstract,
and therefore essentially affected with negation,
it is equally affected with being-for-other.
We have here not only quality and reality,
existent determinateness,
but determinateness existent-in-itself;
and the development consists in positing
such determinateness as thus immanently reflected.`,

constitution, which appears to be grounded in something external,

from this affirmative existence

The negation of its other is only
the quality of the something,

The other, for its part,
truly confronts an existence
only with this sublation;
it confronts the first something only externally,

that is, according to their concept,
their connectedness consists in this,
that existence has passed over into otherness,
something into other;
that something is just as much an other as the other is.
Now in so far as the in-itselfness is
the non-being of the otherness
that is contained in it
but is at the same time
also distinct as existent,
something is itself negation,
the ceasing to be of an other in it;
it is posited as behaving negatively in relation to
the other and in so doing preserving itself.
This other, the in-itselfness of
the something as negation of the negation,
is the something's being-in-itself,

of the other something external to it.
It is one determinateness of the two somethings

is identical with the in-itselfness of the somethings,

to each other as other somethings,
joins them together of their own accord

equally separates them.
This determinateness is limit.`,

the something in its limit in which it is immanent,
the contradiction that propels it beyond itself.

the line, the dialectic of becoming plane;
the plane, of becoming total space.
A second definition is given of line, plane, and whole space
which has the line come to be through the movement of the point;
the plane through the movement of the line, and so forth.
This movement of the point, the line, and so forth, is
however viewed as something accidental,
or as movement only in figurative representation.
In fact, however, this view is taken back by supposing that
the determinations from which the line, and so forth,
originate are their elements and principles,

nothing else but their limits;
the coming to be is not considered as accidental

That the point, the line, the plane, are per se
self-contradictory beginnings which on their own
repel themselves from themselves,
and consequently that the point passes over
from itself into the line through its concept,
moves in itself and makes the line come to be,
and so on all this lies in the concept of the limit
which is immanent in the something.
The application itself, however,
belongs to the treatment of space;
as an indication of it here, we can say that
the point is the totally abstract limit,

this existence is still taken in total abstraction,
it is the so-called absolute, that is, abstract space,
the absolutely continuous being-outside-one-another.

inasmuch as it is spatial determinateness,
the point is spatial, is the contradiction
of abstract negation and continuity
