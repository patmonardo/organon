    text: `c. Finitude

Existence is determinate.
Something has a quality,
and in this quality it is
not only determined but delimited;
its quality is its limit and, affected by it,
something remains affirmative, quiescent existence.
But, so developed that the opposition of its existence
and of the negation as the limit immanent to this existence is
the very in-itselfness of the something,
and this is thus only becoming in it,
this negation constitutes the finitude of the something.`,

      'Quality is limit. When the limit (negation) is immanent to existence as its in‑itself, it renders the something a mere becoming—this immanent negation is finitude.'

we understand by this that they not only have a determinateness,
that their quality is not only reality
and existent determination,
that they are not merely limited
and as such still have existence outside their limit,
but rather that non-being constitutes their nature, their being.
Finite things are, but in their reference to themselves
they refer to themselves negatively
in this very self-reference
they propel themselves beyond themselves,
beyond their being.
They are, but the truth of this being is
(as in Latin) their finis, their end.
The finite does not just alter,
as the something in general does,
but perishes, and its perishing is
not just a mere possibility,
as if it might be without perishing.
Rather, the being as such of finite things is
to have the germ of this transgression
in their in-itselfness:
the hour of their birth is the hour of their death.`,

    text: `(a) The immediacy of finitude

The thought of the finitude of things
brings this mournful note with it
because finitude is qualitative negation driven to the extreme,
and in the simplicity of such a determination
there is no longer left to things
an affirmative being distinct from their determination,
as things destined to ruin.
Because of this qualitative simplicity of negation
that has returned to the abstract opposition of
nothing and perishing to being,
finitude is the most obstinate of
the categories of the understanding;
negation in general, constitution, limit,
are compatible with their other, with existence;
even the abstract nothing, by itself,
is given up as an abstraction;
but finitude is negation fixed in itself
and, as such, stands in stark contrast to its affirmative.`,
    concise:
      'Finitude appears “mournful” because it fixes qualitative negation: nothing/perishing opposed to being. Unlike constitution/limit, it won’t reconcile—hence the understanding’s most obstinate category.'

this is precisely what it is,
that it should come to an end,

Its refusal is rather to let itself be brought
affirmatively to its affirmative, the infinite,
to be associated with it;
it is therefore inseparably posited with its nothing,
and thereby cut off from any reconciliation
with its other, the affirmative.
The determination of finite things does not go past their end.
The understanding persists in this sorrow of finitude,
for it makes non-being the determination of things
and, at the same time, this non-being imperishable and absolute.
Their transitoriness would only pass away in their other,
in the affirmative;
their finitude would then be severed from them;
but this finitude is their unalterable quality, that is,
their quality which does not pass over into their other, that is,
not into the affirmative;
and so finitude is eternal.`,

But that the finite is absolute is
certainly not a standpoint that any philosophy or outlook,
or the understanding, would want to endorse.
The opposite is rather expressly present
in the assertion of finitude:
the finite is the restricted, the perishable,
the finite is only the finite, not the imperishable;
all this is immediately part and parcel
of its determination and expression.
But all depends on whether
in one's view of finitude its being is insisted on,
and the transitoriness thus persists,
or whether the transitoriness and the perishing perish.`,

on precisely the view that would make
the perishing the final end of the finite.
The official claim is that the finite is
incompatible with the infinite
and cannot be united with it;
that the finite is absolutely opposed to the infinite.
Being, absolute being, is ascribed to the infinite.
The finite remains held fast over against it as its negative;
incapable of union with the infinite,
it remains absolute on its own side;
from the affirmative, from the infinite,
it would receive affirmation and thus it would perish;
but a union with the infinite is precisely
what is declared impossible.
If the finite were not to persist over against the infinite
but were to perish, its perishing, as just said,
would then be the last of it;
not its affirmative, which would be only
a perishing of the perishing.
However, if it is not to perish into the affirmative

then we are back at that first, abstract nothing
that itself has long since passed away.`,

but in the finite it is instead expressed.
In the one case, the contradiction appears as subjective;
in the other, the finite is said to stand
in perpetual opposition to the infinite,
in itself to be null, and to be as null in itself.
This is now to be brought to consciousness.
The development of the finite will show that,
expressly as this contradiction, it collapses internally,
but that, in this collapse, it actually resolves the contradiction;
it will show that the finite is not just perishable, and that it perishes,
but that the perishing, the nothing, is rather not the last of it;

This contradiction is indeed abstractly present

But something or being is no longer posited abstractly

that has determination and constitution in it,

that it has a limit within it;

is finitude.
It is to be seen what moments are contained
