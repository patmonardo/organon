    text: `b. Alternating determination of finite and infinite

The infinite is; in this immediacy it is at the same time the negation of an other, the finite.
As existent and as non-being of an other it falls back into the category of the something, something with a limit.
Thus the finite stands over against the infinite; the immediacy of the infinite resurrects the being of its negation, the finite.`,

Infinity = the nothing of the finite, the in‑itself the finite ought to be—reflected-into-self, realized ought, affirmative self-referring being.
Satisfaction: determinateness, alteration, restriction and the ought vanish; the nothing of the finite is posited (as negation of negation, affirmative in itself).`,

    text: `Yet this affirmation is qualitative immediacy (Being), hence again opposed by a finite other.
The infinite is burdened with opposition to the finite—“that which is not finite,” a being in the determinateness of negation.
Over against finite realities, the infinite is indeterminate emptiness, a beyond whose in‑itself is not in its determinate existence.`,

Taken as simple Being, the contained negation is downgraded to immediate negation (determinateness/limit) and excluded as finite—hence the infinite is again finitized.
Since each is through its determination the positing of the other, they are inseparable; but this unity lies hidden in their qualitative otherness.`,

We return to the prior determination; the new limit is to be sublated; emptiness returns—so on to infinity.`,

    text: `The “infinite progress” remains burdened by finitude and is itself finite; yet thereby it is posited as unity of finite and infinite—only not reflected. This hidden unity alone rouses each in the other and drives the progress. Representation fixates on the outside: the empty unrest of crossing limits, ever finding new limits, unable to halt at either limit or infinite.
