1. In the reciprocal determination (alternation) of finite and infinite, the truth of both is implicitly present. The alternation is an external realization of the concept (a falling apart of two sides). All that is needed is to compare the two moments to take up their unity. “Unity of finite and infinite” is an uneven expression; its correction will appear in the externalization ahead.`,
