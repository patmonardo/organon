# Hegel on Sāṃkhya: Guṇas as “qualities of the Absolute Idea”

This note is a seed for a **Fichte–Kant–Hegel** commentary on **Sāṃkhya/Yoga**, meant to support a future syllable-by-syllable study of the Yoga Sūtras.

## Primary Hegel Passage (verbatim)

“The Sanc'hya, and likewise the other Indian systems of Philosophy, occupy themselves particularly with the three qualities (Guna) of the absolute Idea, which are represented as substances and as modifications of nature. It is noteworthy that in the observing consciousness of the Indians it struck them that what is true and in and for itself contains three determinations, and the Notion of the Idea is perfected in three moments. This sublime consciousness of the trinity, which we find again in Plato and others, then went astray in the region of thinking contemplation, and retains its place only in Religion, and there but as a Beyond. Then the understanding penetrated through it, declaring it to be senseless; and it was Kant who broke open the road once more to its comprehension. The reality and totality of the Notion of everything, considered in its substance, is absorbed by the triad of determinations; and it has become the business of our times to bring this to consciousness.”

## Comment (Fichte–Kant–Hegel lens)

### 1) What Hegel is giving us

Hegel is not merely reporting Indian doctrine; he is giving a **diagnostic**:

- the guṇa-triad is (in intention) a triadic determination of what is “true in and for itself,”
- but it becomes “senseless” for the *understanding* once it is treated as a set of external substances,
- and modern philosophy’s task is to retrieve its truth as a *Notion/Idea* structure (triadic determination), not as naive metaphysics.

This is why Hegel can say both (a) the Indians “saw” something correct and (b) it “went astray” in thinking.

### 2) Why Kant matters here (and why a Fichtean correction follows)

Hegel’s claim that “Kant broke open the road” can be read narrowly as:

- Kant re-legitimates the **transcendental** question: not “what is out there,” but “what must be presupposed for knowing/experience?”

But the missing bridge (for our purposes) is the Fichtean one:

- the unconditioned is not grasped as an object;
- it is disclosed as an **act** (self-positing / self-making) that can be *lived* and *made explicit*.

This becomes a direct conceptual hinge for Yoga.

## Bridge to Yoga (taraka → kaivalya)

The Yoga Sūtras can be read as a semantic calculus that defines maximum cognition and its terminal consequence:

- YS 3.54 defines discrimination-born knowing as deliverative, total in object-domain and “manner,” and non-sequential.
- YS 3.55 defines kaivalya as the terminal condition where the sattvic instrument’s śuddhi no longer introduces remainder/distortion relative to puruṣa.

Two working notes that operationalize this:

- `gds/doc/yoga-taraka-fichte-1804-lecture-27.md`
- `gds/doc/yoga-kaivalya-fichte-1804-lecture-28.md`

## Chapter naming thesis (preview)

If Book IV is dominated by dharma-operators (lawfulness of transformation, seed/residue causality, dharma-megha, and meta-law), then “Kaivalya-pāda” names only the *result* while concealing the *mechanism*. A title like “Dharma-pāda” is a semantic claim: Book IV is the systematic exposition of lawful genesis whose closure is kaivalya.
