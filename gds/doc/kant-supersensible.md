## Part I — The forcing function (antinomy)

Remark II. The following important comment suggests itself here: namely, that there are three kinds of antinomy of pure reason, which, however, all coincide in this, that they force reason to give up the otherwise very natural presupposition that holds objects of the senses to be things in themselves, and rather to count them as appearances, and ascribe to them an intelligible substratum (something supersensible, the concept of which is only an idea and permits no genuine cognition). Without such an antinomy reason would never be able to decide on the assumption of a principle that so narrows the field of its speculation and on sacrifices in which so many otherwise shining hopes must entirely disappear; for even now, when in compensation for these losses an all the greater employment opens up for it in a practical respect, it seems unable to depart from those hopes and to free itself from its old dependency without pain.

## Part II — Why three antinomies (faculties)

That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles; for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself. There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cognition; 2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure; 3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles.

## Part III — The aesthetic antinomy and failed subterfuges

With regard to two antinomies of those higher cognitive faculties, that of the theoretical and that of the practical employment, we have already shown elsewhere their unavoidability if judgments of this kind do not look back to a supersensible substratum of the given objects, as appearances, but also their resolvability as soon as the latter happens. Now as far as the antinomy in the use of the power of judgment and the resolution of it given here are concerned, there is no other means for avoiding it than either to deny that the aesthetic judgment of taste is grounded on any principle a priori, so that all claim to the necessity of universal assent is a groundless, empty delusion, and a judgment of taste deserves to be held to be correct only insofar as it happens that many people agree about it, and even this, strictly speaking, not because one suspects an a priori principle behind this consensus, but rather (as in the taste of the palate) because the subjects are contingently organized in the same way; or one must assume that the judgment of taste is really a concealed judgment of reason about the perfection that is revealed in a thing and the relation of the manifold in it to an end, so that it is called aesthetic only on account of the confusion that attaches to this reflection of ours, although at bottom it is teleological – in which case one could declare the resolution of the antinomy by means of transcendental ideas to be unnecessary and void, and thus unite those laws of taste with the objects of the senses not as mere appearances but also as things in themselves. But how little the one as well as the other subterfuge succeeds has been shown in several places in the exposition of the judgments of taste.

## Part IV — The supersensible triad

But if it is conceded that our deduction is at least on the right track, even if it has not been made clear enough in every detail, then three ideas are revealed: first, that of the supersensible in general, without further determination, as the substratum of nature; second, the very same thing, as the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our faculty of cognition; third, the very same thing, as the principle of the ends of freedom and principle of the correspondence of freedom with those ends in the moral sphere.
