## Orientation and scope

- Aim: clarify Remark II’s “three kinds of antinomy” as mapping to the three higher faculties (understanding, judgment, reason), and show how this sets up the dualism problem that Fichte attacks.
- Keep [gds/doc/kant-supersensible.md](kant-supersensible.md) as the clean Kant text; use this file for scaffolding and for links to the Fichte refutation note at [gds/doc/refutation-kantian-dualism-kant-fichte.md](refutation-kantian-dualism-kant-fichte.md).

## Part II focus — how each antinomy forces the unconditioned

Kant’s “three kinds” in the Remark are not three new contradictions inside one book; they are three sites where reason presses each faculty’s a priori use to the unconditioned and hits an impasse unless the sensible is treated as appearance with a supersensible ground.

- Theoretical (Critique of Pure Reason cosmological antinomies; faculty: understanding, use: theoretical): categories applied to the world-series lead reason to demand the unconditioned totality of conditions (first cause, absolute necessity, etc.). Taking appearances as things in themselves generates opposed proofs (e.g., world must have a beginning / must be infinite). Resolution: reclassify the sensible as appearance and posit a supersensible substratum.
- Aesthetic (Critique of Judgment antinomy of taste; faculty: power of judgment, use: aesthetic): taste claims autonomy from concepts yet demands universal assent. Reason insists on an unconditioned ground for that claim. The only non-contradictory move is to locate a supersensible common ground of our faculties (subjective purposiveness), not a determinate concept of the object.
- Practical (Critique of Practical Reason antinomy of pure practical reason; faculty: reason, use: practical): the moral law demands the highest good (unity of virtue and happiness) as unconditioned; nature’s causal order makes it look impossible. Reason demands the unconditioned unity of freedom and nature, yielding postulates (freedom, immortality, God) as supersensible conditions.

Summary: theoretical reason “operates” at the level of the understanding; taste at the level of judgment; practical reason, in its own self-legislating use, is the faculty of reason proper. In each case, reason unremittingly demands the unconditioned and is forced to the supersensible once appearances are denied thing-in-itself status.

## How Fichte (1804) targets the Kantian dualism exposed here

- Problem exposed by the Remark: the system still leans on disjunctions (appearance/thing-in-itself, nature/freedom, sensible/supersensible) plus a connector it cannot generate from within the terms.
- Fichte’s move (see the refutation note): any highest principle with leftover distinction fails; “being” cannot be posited without simultaneous consciousness-of-being; the absolute is the indivisible oneness of knowing/being (pure knowing, A). That removes the need for a third bridge and dissolves the dualism that the three antinomies keep surfacing.
- Opus Postumum hints that Kant himself feels this pressure (self-positing subject as originator of system); Fichte radicalizes it and offers the genetic unity the dualistic architecture lacks.

### Bridge to the 1804 Prolegomena (the “meat” of the refutation)

- Source: [gds/doc/fichte-prolegomena.md](fichte-prolegomena.md). This is where Fichte sets the criterion that refutes dualism: any “highest principle” that admits even the possibility of a distinction collapses.
- Core claim: truth = absolute oneness; multiplicity always comes as a dyad (every term has an antithesis). “Pure knowing” (A) is the indivisible oneness of knowing/being; being-without-knowing or knowing-without-being is half a disjunction and therefore not absolute.
- Why it bites Kant’s Remark II: the three antinomies show reason “unremittingly demands the unconditioned.” Fichte says that demand cannot be met by positing a supersensible bridge alongside appearances; the only satisfying unconditioned is the self-positing unity that is already both sides at once.
- Resulting map: theoretical/judgment/practical antinomies = places where reason exposes the need for an unconditioned. Fichte’s A supplies that unconditioned as genetic unity, not as a postulated connector. That is why the Prolegomena supplies the substantive refutation, while the refutation note supplies the immanent staging via late Kant.

#### Reading note on the “three absolutes” passage (Prolegomena)

- Fichte’s claim: Kant glimpsed A (indivisible unity of being/thinking) but treated it only as a common property of three primordial modes (x, y, z), yielding “three absolutes” instead of one. Those modes track Kant’s three higher cognitive faculties (understanding/judgment/reason) and their antinomies.
- Implication for Remark II: if each faculty’s antinomy is resolved by its own supersensible postulate, the system fractures into three “roots.” Fichte insists the true root must be a single self-positing A from which both sensible and supersensible worlds are conceptually derived.
- Tie to logic work: when modeling the three higher powers, guard against encoding three disconnected unconditioneds; the Fichtean demand is for a genetic unity that yields the triad without making them three ultimates.
- Turiya/OM analogy (yoga cross-reference): Kant’s three “absolutes” (x/y/z) resemble A-U-M as three articulated worlds; Fichte’s A plays the role of turiya/nondual OM—the self-positing unity that is not a fourth thing but the ground in which the triad arises and is held together.
- Kant’s “the very same thing” is deliberately thin: a marker that one supersensible must underwrite all three uses, but without a genetic account of how. Fichte’s objection is that this placeholder (a hand-wave toward unity) does not meet reason’s demand for the unconditioned; only a self-positing A/turiya would.
- First Critique backdrop: even in KrV Kant notes that “the absolute” has dropped out of philosophy’s vocabulary; the antinomies are his way of showing why. Remark II reprises that loss—reason longs for the unconditioned/absolute but, within the critical frame, can only mark it as “the supersensible” without claiming cognition of it. Fichte’s 1804 move is to reclaim the absolute as a knowable (in knowing itself) ground.
- Mandukya link (turiya as “same supersensible”): the supersensible common ground Kant invokes for taste is structurally the nondual ground the Mandukya calls turiya—neither one more state nor one more object, but the unity that lets the three states/faculties co-belong. Kant leaves it as a marker; Fichte insists it must be shown as self-positing.
- Hegel/Fichte contrast: Kant’s “very same thing” stays factical; Fichte (and Hegel’s logic of unity-in-triad) demand the common ground be exhibited as generative, not merely named. In our stack, aim for GDS as the shared substrate that generates/coordinates Logic/Model/Task (triad) without turning them into three disconnected “absolutes.”
- Genetic vs placeholder absolute: Kant is heroic in tracing reason’s demand for the unconditioned but remains with a non-genetic placeholder (“same supersensible”) to stop dualism’s bleed. Fichte/Hegel are monists who recast categories/ideas as a genetic dialectic, producing the triads from a self-positing absolute instead of patching dualisms.

#### Sidebar: substrate vs supersensible, Kant and yogic analogues

- “Substrate” can mean substance/substrate (dyad) rather than Kant’s thin supersensible marker. In KrV, understanding (manas as rule-giver/indriya-coordinator) legislates nature via categories; in that sense it functions as the substrate of nature’s laws.
- Fichte’s split of the Absolute into B/T and x/y/z aligns with a Name/Form division: the Absolute self-divides organically (fivefold Name-Form/Form-Name) and reappears as antar-karana + sat-karya (manas/understanding as nature’s substrate).
- The Kantian “same supersensible” names this ground without exhibiting its genesis; the yogic and Fichtean frames insist on showing how the division arises from the Absolute rather than leaving it as factical.
- Fichte’s genetic move: he replaces Kant’s factical placeholder with an absolute law-giver (pure knowing) that generates the dyads (e.g., sattva → sattva:tamas) instead of patching them; this is his reading of the Copernican turn as a self-positing source, not just a shift of standpoint.
- Sankara gunas parallel: sattva as unity, rajas as unity, tamas as trinity; the rajas → sattva/tamas split yields “unity of unity of trinity.” Fichte’s point: the absolute (sattva) can enter tamas while remaining one, showing a generative unity that carries the triad without breaking into three absolutes.
- Substance “next to” issue: Fichte rejects Spinozan substance-as-necessity; he can allow a stronger determination “next to” substance only because substance is not absolute. The absolute for him/Hegel is the nonappearing Light/self-positing freedom, not a necessitarian substrate with accidental predicates.
- Absolute relation vs nondual One: you can treat Substance:Substrate as an “absolute relation” (triadic coordination) while reserving the nonappearing Light/nondual One as beyond that relation. Substantial knowledge then names the reality of truth within the relation, not truth itself.

## Archived commentary (as previously stored)

Kant's "Remark II" touches on a crucial aspect of his philosophy, particularly concerning the limitations and nature of human cognition. Let's break down this passage to understand its implications:

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**Remark II.** **The following important comment suggests itself here: namely, that there are three kinds of antinomy of pure reason, which, however, all coincide in this, that they force reason to give up the otherwise very natural presupposition that holds objects of the senses to be things in themselves, and rather to count them as appearances, and ascribe to them an intelligible substratum (something supersensible, the concept of which is only an idea and permits no genuine cognition).**

1.  **Three Kinds of Antinomy**: Kant refers to three types of conflicts (antinomies) within pure reason. These antinomies arise when reason reaches contradictory conclusions when it tries to go beyond possible experience and comprehend the totality of phenomena (e.g., the beginning of the universe, the nature of causality).

2.  **Natural Presupposition**: He notes that the natural tendency of human reason is to assume that the objects we perceive through our senses are things in themselves (that is, they exist independently of our perception).

3.  **Appearance vs. Thing-in-Itself**: Kant argues that these antinomies force us to reconsider this assumption. Instead of viewing sensory objects as things in themselves, we should regard them as appearances. This implies that what we perceive is not the ultimate reality but a representation shaped by our cognitive faculties.

4.  **Intelligible Substratum**: He suggests that there is an underlying reality (a "supersensible" or "intelligible substratum") behind these appearances. However, this reality is only an idea and cannot be known through empirical means or genuine cognition.

**Without such an antinomy reason would never be able to decide on the assumption of a principle that so narrows the field of its speculation and on sacrifices in which so many otherwise shining hopes must entirely disappear;**

5.  **Purpose of Antinomies**: The role of these antinomies is to push reason towards a crucial realization. Without encountering these contradictions, reason would never adopt a principle that limits its speculative reach. This limitation, although it might seem like a sacrifice, is essential for avoiding erroneous conclusions about the nature of reality.

**for even now, when in compensation for these losses an all the greater employment opens up for it in a practical respect, it seems unable to depart from those hopes and to free itself from its old dependency without pain.**

6.  **Practical Compensation**: Although reason must give up some speculative ambitions, it gains a greater role in practical philosophy. This shift from speculative to practical reason allows for a deeper engagement with moral and ethical concerns.

7.  **Difficulty of Transition**: Kant acknowledges the difficulty reason faces in letting go of its speculative hopes. This transition involves a painful process of breaking free from old dependencies and habits of thought.

### Summary and Implications

Kant's remark illustrates a critical juncture in his philosophy where pure reason is compelled to recognize its limitations. The antinomies, by highlighting the contradictions in speculative reason, force a reevaluation of our understanding of sensory objects and their relation to the underlying reality. This leads to the crucial distinction between appearances (phenomena) and things in themselves (noumena).

By accepting this distinction, reason can avoid futile speculations about the ultimate nature of reality, focusing instead on practical matters where it can achieve genuine knowledge and make significant contributions to human understanding and ethical life. This transition, while difficult, marks a necessary evolution in the use of reason.

That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles; for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself. There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cognition; 2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure; 3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles. This section of Kant's remark elaborates on the nature and origin of the three kinds of antinomy he previously mentioned. Let's analyze it line by line to understand its implications:

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles;**

1.  **Three Cognitive Faculties**: Kant identifies three primary faculties of cognition: understanding, judgment, and reason. Each of these faculties operates based on principles that are known a priori (independent of experience).

2.  **A Priori Principles**: These faculties each have their own a priori principles, which are fundamental rules or concepts that structure our experience and knowledge.

**for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself.**

3.  **Demand for the Unconditioned**: Reason, when reflecting on these principles and their application, seeks the unconditioned basis for any given conditioned reality. This is a pursuit of an ultimate, foundational principle that does not depend on anything else.

4.  **Limitation of Sensible Knowledge**: This unconditioned basis cannot be found if we treat sensory objects (the sensible) as things in themselves. Instead, we must recognize them as mere appearances, with their true nature being something supersensible (intelligible substratum).

5.  **Supersensible Substratum**: The true, underlying reality is the intelligible substratum that lies beyond sensory experience. It is the thing in itself, which cannot be directly known through empirical means but is necessary to account for the coherence of our experiences.

**There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cognition;**

6.  **Antinomy in Theoretical Use**: The first antinomy arises in the theoretical use of the understanding, which seeks to extend knowledge to the unconditioned basis of cognition. This involves conflicts when reason attempts to comprehend the totality of conditions.

**2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure;**

7.  **Antinomy in Aesthetic Use**: The second antinomy occurs in the aesthetic use of the power of judgment, particularly in relation to feelings of pleasure and displeasure. This reflects the tension between subjective aesthetic experiences and the universal principles we seek to apply to them.

**3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles.**

8.  **Antinomy in Practical Use**: The third antinomy concerns the practical use of reason, particularly in its role as self-legislative. This involves conflicts between the moral law (an a priori principle) and the pursuit of desires, highlighting the challenge of applying unconditional moral principles to concrete situations.

### Summary and Implications

Kant's exposition here highlights the intrinsic conflicts (antinomies) that arise within pure reason as it seeks to extend its principles beyond the limits of possible experience. These antinomies reflect deeper issues within the three faculties of cognition—understanding, judgment, and reason—each striving to apply its a priori principles unconditionally.

-   **Understanding**: Faces antinomies when reason attempts to comprehend the ultimate basis of theoretical knowledge.
-   **Judgment**: Encounters conflicts in the realm of aesthetics, where subjective aesthetic experiences of beauty and taste resist universal categorization.
-   **Reason**: Struggles in its practical application, particularly in reconciling moral imperatives with the desires and conditions of practical life.

These antinomies ultimately force a reconsideration of the assumptions about the nature of sensory objects and the scope of human cognition, pushing reason to recognize its limits and the necessity of an intelligible substratum behind appearances. This shift is crucial for Kant's critical philosophy, as it underscores the boundaries of human knowledge and the importance of practical reason in navigating these limitations.

With regard to two antinomies of those higher cognitive faculties, that of the theoretical and that of the practical employment, we have already shown elsewhere their unavoidability if judgments of this kind do not look back to a supersensible substratum of the given objects, as appearances, but also their resolvability as soon as the latter happens. Now as far as the antinomy in the use of the power of judgment and the resolution of it given here are concerned, there is no other means for avoiding it than either to deny that the aesthetic judgment of taste is grounded on any principle a priori, so that all claim to the necessity of universal assent is a groundless, empty delusion, and a judgment of taste deserves to be held to be correct only insofar as it happens that many people agree about it, and even this, strictly speaking, not because one suspects an a priori principle behind this consensus, but rather (as in the taste of the palate) because the subjects are contingently organized in the same way; or one must assume that the judgment of taste is really a concealed judgment of reason about the perfection that is revealed in a thing and the relation of the manifold in it to an end, so that it is called aesthetic only on account of the confusion that attaches to this reflection of ours, although at bottom it is teleological – in which case one could declare the resolution of the antinomy by means of transcendental ideas to be unnecessary and void, and thus unite those laws of taste with the objects of the senses not as mere appearances but also as things in themselves. But how little the one as well as the other subterfuge succeeds has been shown in several places in the exposition of the judgments of taste.

But if it is conceded that our deduction is at least on the right track, even if it has not been made clear enough in every detail, then three ideas are revealed: first, that of the supersensible in general, without further determination, as the substratum of nature; second, the very same thing, as the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our faculty of cognition; third, the very same thing, as the principle of the ends of freedom and principle of the correspondence of freedom with those ends in the moral sphere.
