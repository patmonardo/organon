# Kaivalya (YS 3.55) — A Fichtean Reading (1804, Lecture 28)

This note records a reading of Yoga Sūtra **3.55** through the lens of Fichte’s *Wissenschaftslehre* (Science of Knowing), specifically **Lecture 28 (Fri, June 8, 1804)** (as provided).

It is paired with the taraka note (YS 3.54 + Lecture 27) and is intended for a future syllable-by-syllable study.

## Anchor Sūtra

### YS 3.55

**Devanāgarī**

सत्त्वपुरुषयोः शुद्धिसाम्ये कैवल्यमिति ॥ ३.५५॥

**IAST**

sattvapuruṣayoḥ śuddhisāmye kaivalyam iti || 3.55 ||

**Padaccheda (one clean split)**

- sattva-puruṣayoḥ
- śuddhi-sāmye
- kaivalyam
- iti

---

## Grammar-First Parse

- **sattva-puruṣayoḥ** — genitive dual: “of sattva and puruṣa.”
- **śuddhi-sāmye** — locative singular: “in the sameness/equality of śuddhi.”
- **kaivalyam** — nominative/accusative neuter singular in sūtra-style predication: “kaivalya.”
- **iti** — definitional closure: “thus / it is said.”

Minimal literal construal:

“When there is equality of śuddhi between sattva and puruṣa — [that is] kaivalya; thus.”

---

## Semantic Claim (Kaivalya of Jñāna)

A common drift is to hear this as “balancing two substances” (matter vs consciousness). The sūtra reads more precisely if “sattva” is heard as **the sattva of the cognitive instrument (buddhi/citta)**.

Working construal:

- **śuddhi** is not moral cleanliness, but *non-distortion / transparency of cognition*.
- **sāmya** is not identity, but “no remainder”: the instrument’s clarity is such that it no longer adds coloration, appropriation, or pseudo-subjectivity.
- Therefore **kaivalya** names the terminal non-mixing: puruṣa stands “alone” because the instrument has become perfectly non-deceptive.

This is why 3.54 → 3.55 is tight:

- 3.54 defines a maximal discrimination-born knowing (unrestricted domain, unrestricted manner, non-sequential).
- 3.55 names the terminal condition this knowing accomplishes: equality-of-śuddhi (no remainder) between the instrument’s sattva and puruṣa.

## Fichte Mapping (Lecture 28 → “Śuddhisāmya”)

### The core Fichte problem: ambiguity of the absolute in a doubled reason

Fichte’s Lecture 28 opens by forcing an ambiguity:

- Reason appears twice: “once in us and once outside of us.”
- Which is the sole absolute? Is the outward projection grounded in an outward reason, or does outward reason arise only through reason’s self-projection in us?

Yoga analogue:

- The cognitive instrument (sattvic buddhi) can present something that looks absolute.
- The decisive task is not to idolize the presentation but to remove ambiguity: what is instrumentally projected vs what is unprojectable.

### “Reason makes itself unconditionally intuiting” as the *operator* of purification

Fichte’s decisive operator in Lecture 28 is:

- reason makes itself unconditionally intuiting,
- which fills the gap between subject and object,
- requiring abstraction from objectifying intuition to stand in the midpoint.

Yoga analogue:

- **śuddhi** is exactly the progressive removal of objectifying remainder.
- **sāmya** names the terminal point where the instrument no longer mis-poses itself as an absolute subject.

So: *śuddhisāmya* is the Yoga-form of removing the “dual absolute” ambiguity.

### The “midpoint” as the kaivalya condition

Fichte insists:

- we must stand neither in the objectified reason nor in subjective reason,
- but in the midpoint of absolutely effective self-making.

Yoga analogue:

- kaivalya is not an additional experience; it is the terminal stance where the “I-making” no longer binds puruṣa to its instruments.

## Chapter Naming Note (preview)

You’ve flagged that Book IV is obscured when it is titled “Kaivalya-pāda.” A Fichte-Kant frame makes it plausible to title Book IV by its governing operator instead of its terminal label.

Working hypothesis:

- “Kaivalya-pāda” names the *conclusion*.
- “Dharma-pāda” names the *mechanism* repeatedly analyzed in Book IV: the lawful transformations (*pariṇāma*), seeds/traces (*āśaya*), causality of karmic formation, and culminations such as **dharma-megha-samādhi** (4.29), which is explicitly “dharma-” keyed.

I’ll do a stricter chapter-naming pass after we anchor a few Book IV sūtras in the same operator style.

### Twenty-eighth Lecture — Friday, June 8, 1804

Honored Guests:

Here is where we stood:
reason is the unconditional ground of its own existence
and its own objectivity for itself,
and its primordial life consists just in this.

I assume that this intrinsically dull sentence has
become familiar to you in all its importance
in the preceding lectures, especially the last.
Without doubt, we see this,
ourselves intuiting and objectifying reason
(as the logical subject of the sentence,
which according to us should now
further objectify itself)
as its predicate.
Numerically reason occurs here twice,
once in us and once outside of us.
I ask, which one is the sole absolute?
That is, does our projection perchance result
from the primordial projection of the external reason,
about which we have been speaking,
so that we ourselves said what it is that we were?
Or is the reason projected outwardly the result
of its own immediate self-projection in us?
In a word, reason exists in duality,
as subject and object,
both as absolute.
This ambiguity must be removed.

1. We can ground this entire existence
most effectively with the formula
already previously used and proven:
reason makes itself unconditionally intuiting.
I say “it makes itself,” and not “it is intuiting.”
It positively does not arise with intuition's being,
and to the extent that it appears to arise there,
we must abstract from it.
I say, “it makes itself unconditionally”;
as we express ourselves meanwhile:
this making is in no way accidental for it.
Instead, it is entirely and completely necessary.
If its being is posited, the latter [intuiting]
is posited as well, and being unfolds in it.
This is its proper, immediate, and inseparable effect.
(All these propositions are easy,
if one just takes them up
in the strength of energetic thinking.
Taken weakly and inconsistently,
they are confusing and lead to nothing.)

NB: pure, intrinsically clear and transparent
intellectual activity consists in this
“making itself unconditionally intuitive”
in genuine vivacity and existence.

It is raised above all objectifying intuition
as itself the latter's ground,
and it completely fills the gap
between subject and object,
thereby negating both.
Further:
This self-making is just effectiveness,
inner life and activity;
indeed, the activity of self-making, [is]
thus a making oneself into activity.
Here arise at one and the same time
an absolute primordial activity and movement,
and also a making (or copying) of
this primordial activity as its image.
(The former fundamentally explains
the self-making and presenting manifestness
that has grasped us in every investigation;
the latter explains our reconstruction
of this [manifestness]
as it has also consistently appeared to us.)
Now, though, we have to stand
neither in one nor the other,
but rather in the midpoint between both,
that is in the absolutely inwardly
effective self-making,
real through itself,
without any other making or intuition.
We must abstract from the fact
that we go on to objectify
this midpoint as well,
and should in no way admit
the validity of that intuition.
Because otherwise we have in no way
explained the subjective and the objective,
but only added it factically.
This was the first point.
Reason is this, as certainly as it is:
but it is unconditionally.
Now, reason is an absolute, immediate, self-making;
thus, it sets itself down as existing, objectively,
and as making itself, objectively.
The permanent object and the permanent subject,
which initially come into question;
neither one [exists] by way of the other,
as we initially thought,
but instead both [exist] by means of
the same original essential effect in the midpoint.
This was the second point.
Now, the effect through which
it [reason] throws down a permanent object is
the same one through which it threw down objective living,
and therefore the primordial construction,
objective reason, devolves onto this objective life.
In addition, the effect through which
it threw down the persisting subject is
the same one through which it threw down imaging as imaging,
and so this imaging devolves onto the subject.
This was the third point.
Result:
reason, as an immediate, internal, self-intuiting making,
and to that extent an absolute oneness of its effects,
breaks down within the living of this making
into being and making;
into the making of being as made and not made;
and into the [making of] making
as likewise primordial, existing,
and not primordial, copied.
This disjunction, expressed just as we have expressed it,
is what is absolutely original.

2. Now, in the business we have just concluded,
we indeed have objectified and intuited the one reason
as the inwardly self-intuiting making;
but we realize that we must abstract from this,
if we want to recognize reason as the one.
We are also aware that we can indeed abstract from it.
That is, although we are not able
to exempt ourselves from it factically,
we can indeed think of it as not valid in itself.
In this way, reason is actually seen into.
That is, as the primordial self-making,
it fully merges into our imitative image.
Therefore, it is the very same relation
immediately in us that we have just presented objectively.
We, or reason, no longer stand
either in that objective reason
nor in subjective reason;
since we must just abstract from both
instead [we, or reason, stand] purely in
the midpoint of the absolutely effective self-making.
In the science of knowing,
reason is completely, immediately alive,
opened in itself,
and has become an inward “I,”
[both] periphery and center,
(since this is the site of the science of knowing)
as it had to come;
and all this has happened
completely through abstraction.
Absolute reason is absolute
(accomplished) thinking of oneself.
Thinking oneself as such, is reason.
I can then objectify this
very absoluteness of reason
(or the science of knowing),
produced in this way,
or I can not objectify it,
because I abstract from the objectivity,
which factically ceases without my help.
If I do the latter,
then everything ends here,
and reason is enclosed in itself.
If I abandon myself to the former,
then I give myself up to a mere fact
that is completely cut off
and without any principle.
It does not arise out of reason,
since only those things derived here arise from it;
just as little does it arise from something else,
since it is simply absolutely factically given.
Therefore, it is completely inconceivable,
without a principle;
and, once surrendered to it,
nothing remains for me
except just to abandon myself to it.
It is pure, simple appearance.

3. I want to surrender to it.
Now if I objectify this absoluteness,
then it appears to me as an objective situation,
to which I raise myself through free abstraction
from my initially objectifying reason.
“I want to surrender,”  I say;
hence, within appearance I find
an objectively complete “I”
as the original ground and original condition
for this situation.
(Consciousness, and self-consciousness,
as the original fact underlying all other facticity.
The thing whose validity has so far been completely denied [is]
once more derived and justified.)
From the preceding knowledge of reason,
I know very well what the “I” is in itself.
I need not to learn it from appearance,
which would not give me any information about its essence.
It is the result of reason's self-making.
Consequently
(a very important conclusion,
and the only possible one if appearance itself is
to be traced back to reason)
appearance itself is inaccessible only to me,
to the “I” projected absolutely through appearance;
it itself is a self-making of reason,
of reason's primordial effect,
and indeed as an I.
(The imprint of reason's effect
rests solely in the I, as such).

However, a. that I must simply abstract,
if this consciousness is to arise,
and b. that I could either do this or not,
are found purely in appearance, that is,
in reason's effect,
which is inaccessible to me
only in its principle.
Thus, that I am free.

4. What arises through abstraction for me,
as a result of the assertion of appearance?
Reason as absolute oneness:
this arises, and appears as arising.
However, all arising appears as such
only with its opposite.
The opposite of absolute oneness,
which in this oppositional relationship
in turn becomes qualitative oneness,
is absolute multiplicity and variability.
Therefore, if this oneness is to appear genetically,
then consciousness,
from which one must abstract as the beginning point,
must itself appear as absolutely changeable and multiform.
This is the first fundamental principle.
It is also the first application of our basic principle:
if the science of knowing is to arise
(if the science of knowing is to be
precisely an arising, an origin)
then such and such a consciousness must be posited.

5. The I of consciousness in appearance is
an inconceivable effect of reason,
above all materially.
This inconceivability as such
enters immediately into
the primordial consciousness,
which genesis presupposes,
which is unconditionally changeable,
and which exhausts itself in infinite multiplicity.
It does so explicitly as inconceivable, as real.
Reality in appearance is
the same as the primordial effect of reason:
the one eternally selfsame.

6. The I of consciousness is reason's effect
in the conceptual form of this effect,
which we conceived earlier in the four presented terms.
So far, we have presented these four terms
collectively only insofar as we have
penetrated reason as an inner oneness.
As a genetic abstraction, [this oneness] presupposes
external oneness just as before,
and as a primordial effect of reason within experience,
[it] presupposes inner multiplicity.
However, the inner multiplicity and separateness must
necessarily consist in the lack of correlation
in realizing these four terms,
thus in their apprehension as separate principles.
Then, in an absolutely necessary differentiation of principles,
we would have four fundamental principles:

1. In the enduring object,
and indeed in what is absolutely transient:
the principle of sensibility, belief in nature, materialism.

2. In the enduring subject:
belief in personality,
and, given the variety of personalities,
the identity and equality of personality,
the principle of legality.

3. Holding to the absolutely
real forming of the subject,
which, since this forming is
connected to the enduring subject,
conceptually makes the latter into a oneness,
leaving multiplicity just to the former.
[This is] the standpoint of morality,
as an activity that proceeds purely
from the enduring I of consciousness,
continuing through infinite time.

4. Holding to the absolute
imaging and living of the absolute object,
which becomes a oneness
for the same reason introduced in 3. above.
The standpoint of religion,
as belief in a God,
who alone is true for all lifetimes,
and alone is inwardly living.

Now all of these standpoints are effects of reason,
although not realized as such in their principle,
and reason is completely as it is, wherever it is.
Therefore, it is evident that, simply as effects of reason,
the three other standpoints insert themselves
immediately into each of the four,
without any apparent free act of abstraction.
Yet they do so colored by,
and in the spirit of,
the dominant principle.
Thus, among religious people morality exists as well,
but not, as with those having the latter as their principle,
as their proper work.
Instead, it is a divine work in them,
which brings about in them will and fulfillment,
as well as the resulting desire and pleasure.
Other people also exist besides themselves, and a sensible world.
Yet, they do so always only as an emanation of one divine life.
Likewise, too, God exists in morality as a principle,
but not for his own sake;
instead, so that he maintains the moral law.
If they had no moral law, they would not need a God.
Further, other people exist apart from themselves,
but only just so that they can be, or become, moral,
and they have a sensible world simply as a sphere for moral action.
Likewise, God is present for the legal standpoint,
but he exists only in order to manage the
higher police work that lies beyond the reach of human policing.
Legality also has a morality;
however, it coincides with outward integrity
in relation to others, and ends there.
Finally [there is] a sensible world,
for the purpose of civic industry.
Fourth, God surely has a place within the principle of sensibility,
if it is left to itself and does not become
unnaturally depraved through perverse speculation.
That is, God exists so that he can give us food in due season.
With this comes a certain morality,
namely to spread one's pleasures wisely,
that one always has something more to enjoy,
especially not to ruin things
with this God who provides.
Finally, there is also something analogous
to reason and spirituality
and that is also to enjoy these pleasures
in the right order and with prudence.
Hence, there are four basic factors in each standpoint
(five if you also add the unifying principle).
Together these yield twenty main factors
and primordial fundamental determinations of knowing;
and, if you add the science of knowing's
indicated fivefold synthesis,
which we have just completed,
this becomes twenty-five.

It has already been proved that
this division into twenty-five forms
coincides with the absolute breakdown of the real,
or [with the breakdown]
into absolute multiplicity
of that effect of reason,
which is immediately inaccessible in its oneness.
This follows because
multiplicity in general
arises out of the genetic nature of reflection on oneness.
However, this reflection on oneness
immediately breaks down into five-foldness.
Therefore, the manifold from which it is necessary
to abstract breaks down in the form of fivefoldness,
by the same rule of reason.

Above, we have made it immediately clear factically that
this entire consciousness is posited and determined
solely by the genesis of the science of knowing.
If we abstracted from our rational insight,
as a condition objectifying itself immediately in us,
then things would rest there,
and we would not attain anything further.
The insight into the law of all consciousness
arose for us only insofar as we reflected on it,
and thus posited the science of knowing as genesis,
as something that ought to arise,
because of our absolute decree.

The task we had assumed is therefore completely finished,
and our science has closed.
The principles have been presented
with the greatest possible clarity and determinateness.
Anyone who has truly understood and penetrated
the principles can carry out the schematism on his own.
Making many words does not contribute to clarity;
it can even obscure things for the best minds.
Perhaps there will be time and opportunity
this coming winter for applying these principles
to particular standpoints,
for example to religion,
which always should remain the highest,
not only in the partiality and sensible form
in which it was grasped previously,
but in our science's inherent spirit,
and from there to the doctrine
of virtue, and of rights.

Until then, I ask for your benevolent
remembrance for myself and for science,
and I give you my thanks for the new courage
and the new happy prospects for science,
which you have given me so amply
in the course of these lectures.
