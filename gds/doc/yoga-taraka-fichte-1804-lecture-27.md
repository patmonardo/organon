# Taraka Vivekaja Jñāna — A Fichtean Reading (1804, Lecture 27)

This note records a reading of Yoga Sūtra 3.54 (and its immediate consummation in 3.55) through the lens of Fichte’s *Wissenschaftslehre* (Science of Knowing), specifically **Lecture 27 (Wed, June 6, 1804)**.

This is meant as a working document for a future syllable-by-syllable study of the Yoga Sūtras.

## Guiding Claim

YS 3.54 describes a *kind* of cognition (jñānam) whose structure is best read as **transcendental** (in a Fichtean-Kantian sense):

- It is not a “mystical trip” as an episode that ends and leaves only bafflement.
- It is a discrimination-born knowing (*vivekaja jñānam*) whose operators define a maximum of **domain**, **manner**, and **temporal assembly**.

This corresponds to Fichte’s insistence that “transcendental knowing” can only arise by presupposing ordinary knowing, and then exhibiting the genetic necessity by which **seeing permeates itself as seeing**, surrendering its independence and positing absolute being.

---

## Operator Reading of YS 3.54 (Sūtra as Semantics)

Treat the first four terms as stacked predicates (acc. n. sg.) qualifying **jñānam**.

- **vivekajaṃ** — discrimination-born.
  - Not a trance-product; its source is *difference-making* (viveka).

- **tārakam** — deliverative / ferrying-across.
  - Liberation is not a later reward; it is the function of the cognition itself.

- **sarvaviṣayam** — “all-object” (unrestricted object-domain).
  - No restricted region: not merely “this class of objects,” but *any* object whatever.

- **sarvathāviṣayam** — “all-manner object(-reach)” (unrestricted respect/mode).
  - Not just more objects, but every *way* an object can be determinately taken.

- **akramaṃ** — non-sequential.
  - Cognition not assembled by steps; the “whole” is given without temporal laddering.

- **ca iti** — list-marker / definitional closure.
  - The sūtra itself is presenting a compact *taxonomy* of the cognition.

---

## Sphoṭa Hypothesis (Apperceptive Sphoṭa)

The “non-sequential” (*akrama*) character suggests an account closer to **sphoṭa** than to discursive śabda.

- Sound-events (dhvani/nāda) are time-extended and (in ordinary experience) space-indexed.
- Sphoṭa names the meaning-whole that is not the sound-event.

Here the claim is stronger:

- The most lucid sphoṭa is **entirely apperceptive**: meaning is given as the act-structure of apperception, not carried by syllabic unfolding.

This matches the “silent” character of supreme givenness: not talkative, not narrative—yet determinately declaring itself.

---

## Fichte Mapping (Lecture 27 → Yoga Operators)

The mapping is not historical influence, but structural kinship.

### 1) “Seeing posited as seeing → seeing necessarily sees”

Fichte’s pivot:

- If seeing is posited as seeing, then seeing actually takes place.
- The existence of seeing is genetically derived; “life lives,” but the question is whether life is situated in seeing as such.

Yoga analogue:

- **vivekajaṃ jñānam** is not “more content” but a shift in the *genetic source* of cognition.
- Cognition arises from discrimination and therefore has intrinsic necessity, not arbitrariness.

### 2) Self-permeation negates independence and posits being

Fichte:

- Seeing’s self-permeation is an absolute negation of itself as independent.
- It exists only in this self-negation and relating; this act is immediate and actual.

Yoga analogue:

- **tārakam**: deliverance is the cognition’s own act-character.
- Deliverance occurs by surrender of false independence (misidentification), not by annihilation of mind.

### 3) “Absolute reason = light that determines itself”

Fichte describes absolute insight as:

- a light that determines and declares itself,
- self-positing (but “not as itself” in the way ordinary reflection imagines).

Yoga analogue:

- **sarvathāviṣayam** + **akrama**: cognition is total in determinability and not stepwise.
- It is “light” as self-declaring determinacy, not sensory illumination.

### 4) The trap: hypotheticalness, circular conditioning, and the demand that reason speak

Fichte:

- “If seeing is, then…” remains hypothetical.
- We must not “give reason speech” first; reason must start talking directly.

Yoga analogue:

- The passage from ordinary inference/debate into **viveka-born** cognition.
- The transition from discursive tarka to the apperceptive sphoṭa of akrama cognition.

## Why 3.55 Names the Kaivalya of Jñāna

YS 3.55 is a definitional sentence:

- **sattvapuruṣayoḥ**: of sattva and puruṣa (gen. dual)
- **śuddhisāmye**: in equality/sameness of śuddhi (locative)
- **kaivalyam iti**: “this is kaivalya.”

Working construal:

- “Equality” is not identity of substances; it is the terminal condition where the sattvic instrument (buddhi mirror) no longer introduces remainder, distortion, appropriation.
- When the *mirror-clarity* is equal (i.e., perfectly non-distorting), puruṣa stands “alone” (kaivalya) because confusion has no foothold.

So 3.54 provides the maximal cognition; 3.55 names the terminal non-mixing that maximal cognition accomplishes.

## Source Text (as provided)

The following lecture text is included verbatim as it was provided for this note.

### Twenty-seventh Lecture — Wednesday, June 6, 1804

Honored Guests:

Our continuing task is to show that,
if transcendental knowing
(= the existence of absolute knowing)
is to arise, then another,
ordinary knowing must be presupposed.

The permanent result of the last hour is this:
seeing permeating itself as seeing
necessarily surrenders itself
as something independent,
and posits an absolute being.
The latter enters into a further synthesis,
which yields a description of certainty
as an enclosure into itself.

I presented this as the center,
and did not fail to recall
that continuity of connection
had not been achieved
from there out to the endpoints,
but rather that gaps remained.
Today's project is to fill these gaps
from the midpoint outward,
according to absolute knowing
in its oneness.
Clearly, this requires new terms
that are not to be developed from the foregoing.
Meanwhile, this new investigation can
thus be tied to the previous one.
Undoubtedly, it was we, scientists of knowing,
who created this insight into the essence of seeing,
and therefore the other as well,
that seeing is necessarily a form of intuition, etc.
I also add that another entirely different insight,
which we have overlooked, is contained in
this mastering of seeing's essence,
and we will present it now.

1. Namely, I say:
if seeing is posited as seeing,
then it follows that seeing actually takes place;
or, seeing necessarily sees.
So that you do not overlook this sentence's importance
because of its simplicity,
I can justifiably make it more difficult,
by therefore adding the following preliminary remarks.
Evidently, this sentence is the completion
of what is required, but never achieved,
in the scholastic proof of God's existence
as the most real being
(a proof with which you are all familiar)
to infer the existence of a thing
from the bare thought of it.
Seeing posited as seeing means that
it is thought, formed and constructed
in its inner essence,
just as we have done in the last hour;
and this is done hypothetically,
as follows immediately from this construction,
without further ado.
Because, from positing what something is,
nothing at all is established regarding
its existence or non-existence,
and instead, it remains hypothetical.
As surely as this latter alone is posited,
and if “seeing-into” and certainty are enclosed in that,
nothing can be said about it definitively.
However, we reasoned as follows:
“Seeing necessarily occurs,
and so its existence is
positively established and expressed.”
This is the first point.
Thus, we genetically derive being there,
the true inner essence of existence.
Providing this derivation has been our task,
and indeed, the sole immediately derivable
existence is that of seeing.
This is the second point.

2. For either the proof in its full significance
or the insight intended here to arise
requires strenuous attention.
For instance, one could well say life lives,
which is of course correct;
but whether life is situated in seeing,
completely as such,
as we have most intimately intuited it in ourselves,
that is the question.
I handle it like this:
seeing's self-permeation is
an absolute negation of itself as independent,
and a [matter of] relating itself to something external.
It exists only in this self-negation and relating,
and otherwise not.
Yet this negating and relating is
an act that exists just in itself
and in its immediate completion.
Hence, it is necessary, immediate, and actual;
and if the whole is to be,
then it must be and exist.
Seeing cannot be posited,
except as immediately living, powerful, and active.

3. The insight that we have just completed is
now the absolute insight of reason,
that is, absolute reason itself.
In this insight, we have
immediately become absolute reason,
and have dissolved into it.
Let us analyze this insight more closely,
and with it reason as well.
First, reflect purely on the last thing,
the insight itself,
abstracting from the way we came to it:
it itself is a seeing, insight,
thus something external.
It is a seeing of seeing,
thus seeing itself as existent,
absolute and substantial,
a seeing grounded in itself
and as such self-expressive,
[a matter of] certainty and self-enclosure
by virtue of inner necessity.
Thus, as a result of its absolute inner essence,
it is a light that determines and declares itself,
that simply by itself absolutely cannot not be,
and absolutely cannot not be what it is,
just self-positing.
Self-positing, I say, but not as itself.
We have added the last in a way that must now be explained.
Reason's absolute insight sees,
just the seeing under discussion,
but not immediately again its first-named seeing,
because this is an absolute insight.
Proposition: the absolute insight of reason
brings absolute existence
(of seeing, in fact) with itself.
It does so immediately [in the course of]
performing this action,
and as the expression of doing so.
Said differently, absolute reason
permeates itself as reason,
in exactly the way we have indicated,
as absolute effect.
The proposition is important:
I think [it] is immediately clear,
and if for this one or that one it is not,
I can help in the following way.
In the previous hour,
formal seeing permeated itself
as something absolutely outward,
negated itself therein,
and thereby posited being;
not immediately, but rather by means of ____ , etc.
It is otherwise here in absolute reason;
this happens without any mediation.
Thereby, reason shows itself in us, as reason's reason,
thus as absolute reason in this self-permeation
and being permeated by itself.
A doctrine of reason,
through itself, from itself, and in itself,
as this duality can be expressed.
A doctrine of reason,
as the first and highest part
of the science of knowing,
which does not become,
but rather is unconditionally in itself,
and is that which it is.

4. [To say] that reason itself is
the ground of its own proper existence,
here inward, living, and active,
would mean that it posits its life and existence
unconditionally and inseparably from itself.
No living and existence is possible apart from this one,
and it is impossible to escape it.
Now, however, although we say that it cannot be escaped,
we ourselves have obviously done so.
Consequently, reason's genetic life,
which we have described in
positing seeing's absolute existence
in case this latter is merely thought,
is still not reason's primordial
and absolute existence.
That it is not this,
also follows for another reason.
We appear to ourselves as
having completed the very insight
just completed, with freedom.
We indeed are reason,
because reason is simply the I,
and cannot be anything else than I,
according to the proof conducted long since.
Thus “we seem,” or “reason seems,”
are completely synonymous.
Now we appeared here actually as
the ground of the insight's existence,
but not as absolute ground of its actuality,
but rather as the ground of its possibility,
or its free ground.
Thus, we are only a mediate,
factical appearance and insight,
and hence not absolute reason.
This mere possibility is
also evident in another way.
Evidently, this entire insight appears as
the reconstruction of an original construction in reason,
and we objectify this primordial reason,
along with its construction.
We appear to ourselves as yielding ourselves
to the original law of reason by a free act,
and now, gripped by it, as made into manifestness = certainty.
This surrender and this manifestness appear to us
as able to be repeated indefinitely.
Further, the following in particular
should be noted and made more precise.
The premise for the absolutely completed,
rational insight into seeing's inner essence
as something absolutely external
(despite the fact that we do not
let it serve as an absolute premise,
but have instead derived it from pure reason itself)
is still an intrinsic genetic power
for the rational insight into existence,
which has been brought about.
It conditions the latter just as
the latter has conditioned it.
Hence once again the circle
between reciprocal conditionings remains,
and thus the old hypothetical character.
The absolute condition has by no means been disclosed.
That hypotheticalness remains can also be shown in another way,
and it is interesting and instructive to give this demonstration.
“If seeing is, then thus and so are as well,
and from this follows ____ , etc.”
Precisely, therefore, what lies in the conclusion is
presupposed hypothetically in the premise,
and so it holds only on condition that the first is given.
Now, to be sure, we say that absolute reason posits it;
but it is only we who say it, that is, arbitrariness and freedom.
Of course, reason speaks in the connection;
but we have provided it with speech in the first place,
and should not trust it.
Reason itself must start talking directly.

5. In what we have achieved so far,
we have at least learned where this might be discovered.
“Reason itself is immediately and unconditionally
the ground of an existence, indeed of its own existence,
since it cannot be of any other.”
This means:
this existence has no further ground.
It is not possible, as before, to provide a genetic premise,
on the basis of which it can be explained further,
since otherwise it would not be grounded in absolute reason,
but in a reason that would have to be interrogated in its turn.
Instead, we must simply say, it is grounded in reason.
[It is] a pure absolute fact.
Now just what is this fact?
It has accompanied us all along,
and thus in this last investigation as well.
It is expressed in the formula:
“Reason is the absolute ground of its own existence.”
If anyone does not yet see it,
this is because it is too close to him.
We ourselves have continually objectified reason,
and therefore posited its existence, as existence,
in the “form of outer existence.”
Now we are reason.
Therefore, in us ourselves, that is in itself,
absolute reason is the absolute ground of its existence,
that is, of its existence as such.
This is a fact from which we cannot ever escape,
and that cannot be explained or understood
from any further genetic premise,
as must be the case if it is to be
an expression of absolute reason.
(Someone has encountered the enduring
objectification of the absolute,
and has opined that therefore there is no absolute.
How could that be, if, as is the case here,
true absoluteness is not found in what is objectified,
nor in the objectifying [agent],
but rather in the immediate event of objectifying itself?
From time to time, one sufficiently remembers and makes clear
the fact that the absolute must not be sought outside the absolute,
and especially that we would certainly never grasp the absolute,
if we did not even live and conduct it.)

6. Now in this case we are not just the bare fact,
but instead we are simultaneously
the insight that this fact is
reason's pure original expression and life;
that the fact is origin and the origin, fact.
The characteristic mark of the science of knowing
consists purely in this synthesis.
The bare fact, as fact, yields ordinary knowing.
So initially, this self-presentation of reason
itself occurs through reason, we say:
for us, then, how is the latter reason?
I think, if we view it properly,
[it is] objectified in the same way as the former,
and undoubtedly the same one reason as the former.
Thus our life, or the life of reason,
does not escape from its own self-objectification.
And that which is one implicitly
(and probably for ordinary knowing as well)
divides itself within the science of knowing's
insight into a twofold appearance.
Indeed, this division arises only from the insight,
or the genesis of that which in itself is an absolute fact.
This is the first point.
Further, and most significantly,
we have not just found this insight
(that reason alone is the absolute ground of its existence)
immediately in our proposition.
We could not have done so.
This insight alone is what has
turned us into scientists of knowing.
If we had, the highest fact would have required
another genetic premise above itself;
and this in turn another, and so on to infinity.
Then our system would have met the fate
of other systems and found no beginning.
Instead of that, we have found it
in the more profound insight
carried out at the beginning of today's lecture.
Now it is merely applied as
a universal and absolutely valid proposition.
Hence, the absolute insight,
on which everything depends here,
our science as well, is possible only through a deeper one,
which likewise is possible only through another, etc.
In this way, the genuine ground for the connection
between knowing's various basic determinations is
opened up and made accessible.
The deduction can start from the principle:
if the insight obtained in this way,
the science of knowing is possible in its principles,
then must ____ , etc.
This was the second point.
Finally, reason is the ground of its own existence as reason.
For, note well, this and nothing else was
the absolute fact with which we are concerned.
However, it is so only in the insight we have created,
because it is duplicated (is reason as reason)
only within this insight.
Therefore, this very insight,
or the science of knowing, is
reason's immediate expression and life:
the single life of reason unfolded
immediately in itself and permeated by itself.
Precisely because, just as one
lives in it there is seeing,
or it appears, thus reason itself lives and appears.
In its existence, the insight appears
to be possible only by means of freedom;
it is also thus actually and in fact.
That is, in this way reason shows itself
as freely self-expressing.
That freedom should appear is
simply its law and inward essence.
If it appears as conditioned, then it actually is so;
that is, it must appear thus, as it is conditioned, etc.
This is all unconditionally true and certain,
but [it is] true and certain to the exact extent
that it lies within reason
as its necessary appearance and expression.
By no means is it as certain as reason in itself,
to which it in no way comes, except in its expression.
The task on which the truthfulness and certainty
of our insight depends is simply this:
to see everything in its context,
and to articulate it in this context.
Appearing truly exists
when it is conceived
as the absolute appearing
and self-expression of absolute reason,
and without the latter qualification,
it is not true.
It is true that reason appears thus and so,
e.g., as inwardly free,
only insofar as it also appears
as inwardly necessary and actually existing.
Without this qualification, it is not true, etc.

Absolute appearance, or genesis,
has been presented.
The law for deriving it,
and for deducing inferences from it,
has also been presented,
and the deduction can proceed.
With this, I stop at the border
of a philosophia prima
(I would have wished to regard
these lectures as being this),
presenting only appearance's
first basic distinction,
which in its oneness constitutes
the concept of pure appearing as such,
without any further determination of the latter.
In this work, I can either go to work on the details
(in which case I will not end this week),
or I can present the main point
briefly and forcefully
in a single lecture.
To do the latter, I will need more time
for the preparation of this lecture.
I prefer the latter, and ask you to
permit me to defer tomorrow's lecture,
so that I can end on Friday.

## Next (for the 2026 syllable-by-syllable study)

- Build a strict morphological table for each padaccheda term in 3.54–3.55.
- Track how *akrama* behaves across traditions (Yoga vs sphoṭa vs Abhidharma).
- Decide how to name Book IV ("Dharma-pāda" vs "Kaivalya-pāda") as a semantic claim about the chapter’s governing operator.
