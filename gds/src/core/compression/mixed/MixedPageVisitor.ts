/**
 * Mixed Page Visitor - The Archaeological Artifact
 *
 * **ENTERPRISE ARCHAEOLOGY ALERT**: This is the actual visitor pattern
 * interface that was deemed "too complex" and commented out in MixedPage!
 *
 * **The Original Vision**: Type-safe handling of dual-personality pages
 * through the sacred visitor pattern. Every Java enterprise architect's
 * favorite hammer for every nail! ðŸ”¨
 *
 * **Why It Exists**: To provide "type safety" and "extensibility" for
 * handling both Address and byte[] pages in a "clean, OOP way".
 *
 * **Why It Was Abandoned**: Because sometimes even Java developers
 * realize that simple is better than clever! ðŸ˜‚
 *
 * **Educational Value**: A perfect example of enterprise over-engineering
 * that thankfully got simplified before production!

/**
 * Visitor interface for Mixed Page operations.
 *
 * **The Visitor Pattern**:
 * - R: Return type (what the visitor produces)
 * - P: Parameter type (context passed to visitor methods)
 *
 * **How It Would Work**:
 * ```typescript
 * class CompressionVisitor implements MixedPageVisitor<number, CompressionContext> {
 *   visitAddress(address: Address, context: CompressionContext): number {
 *     return this.compressWithPacking(address, context);
 *   }
 *
 *   visitBytes(bytes: Uint8Array, context: CompressionContext): number {
 *     return this.compressWithVarLong(bytes, context);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Usage:
 * const visitor = new CompressionVisitor();
 * const result = mixedPage.accept(visitor, context);
 * ```
 *
 * **What Actually Happened**:
 * ```typescript
 * // Simple, direct approach:
 * if (usePacking(degree)) {
 *   return compressWithPacking(mixedPage.address(), context);
 * } else {
 *   return compressWithVarLong(mixedPage.bytes(), context);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Lesson**: Sometimes an if statement is better than a design pattern! ðŸŽ¯
