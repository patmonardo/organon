/**
 * Abstract builder for creating NodeLabelExporter instances.
 *
 * This builder follows the **Builder Pattern** to provide a fluent, type-safe way
 * to configure and create node label exporters. It handles the common configuration
 * options that all label exporters need, while allowing concrete implementations
 * to add their own specific configuration.
 *
 * **Design Philosophy:**
 * - **Fluent Interface**: Method chaining for readable configuration
 * - **Progressive Disclosure**: Required parameters enforced, optional ones available
 * - **Separation of Concerns**: Common configuration here, implementation-specific in subclasses
 * - **Fail-Fast**: Validation at build time, not runtime
 *
 * **Common Usage Pattern:**
 * ```typescript
 * const exporter = exporterBuilder
 *   .withIdMap(graphIdMap)              // Required: node ID mapping
 *   .withProgressTracker(tracker)       // Optional: progress monitoring
 *   .parallel(executor, concurrency)    // Optional: parallel configuration
 *   .withResultStore(resultStore)       // Optional: result caching
 *   .withTerminationFlag(termFlag)      // Optional: cancellation support
 *   .build();                           // Create the final exporter
 * ```
 *
 * **Concrete Implementations:**
 * - `FileNodeLabelExporterBuilder` - Exports to CSV/JSON files
 * - `MemoryNodeLabelExporterBuilder` - Stores in memory for further processing
 * - `StreamNodeLabelExporterBuilder` - Streams to external systems
 * - `DatabaseNodeLabelExporterBuilder` - Writes to databases (non-Neo4j)
