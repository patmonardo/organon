/**
 * Abstract builder for creating NodePropertyExporter instances.
 *
 * This builder follows the **Builder Pattern** to provide a fluent, type-safe way
 * to configure and create node property exporters. It handles all the common configuration
 * options that property exporters need, while allowing concrete implementations
 * to add their own storage-specific configuration.
 *
 * **Design Philosophy:**
 * - **Fluent Interface**: Method chaining for readable, self-documenting configuration
 * - **Progressive Disclosure**: Required parameters enforced, optional ones available
 * - **Separation of Concerns**: Common configuration here, implementation-specific in subclasses
 * - **Fail-Fast Validation**: Input validation at build time, not runtime
 * - **Immutable Configuration**: Once built, the exporter configuration cannot be changed
 *
 * **Common Usage Pattern:**
 * ```typescript
 * const exporter = exporterBuilder
 *   .withIdMap(graphIdMap)              // Required: node ID mapping and labels
 *   .withProgressTracker(tracker)       // Optional: progress monitoring
 *   .parallel(executor, concurrency)    // Optional: parallel write configuration
 *   .withResultStore(resultStore)       // Optional: result caching
 *   .withTerminationFlag(termFlag)      // Optional: cancellation support
 *   .withJobId(jobId)                   // Optional: operation tracking
 *   .build();                           // Create the final exporter
 * ```
 *
 * **Concrete Implementations:**
 * - `FileNodePropertyExporterBuilder` - Exports to CSV/JSON/Parquet files
 * - `MemoryNodePropertyExporterBuilder` - Stores in memory for further processing
 * - `StreamNodePropertyExporterBuilder` - Streams to external systems via APIs
 * - `DatabaseNodePropertyExporterBuilder` - Writes to databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
 * - `CloudNodePropertyExporterBuilder` - Exports to cloud storage (S3, Azure, GCS)

   * resources in an inconsistent state.
   *
   * **Cancellation Strategy:**
   * - Exporters should check the flag periodically (e.g., every batch)

   * - Partial results should be left in a consistent state when possible

   * Without progress feedback, users don't know if the operation is proceeding normally

   *
   * **Progress Tracking Benefits:**
   * - **Real-time feedback**: Current progress percentage and estimated completion time
   * - **Sub-task monitoring**: Detailed progress for different export phases
   * - **Error reporting**: Immediate notification of issues during export
   * - **Performance monitoring**: Track throughput and identify bottlenecks
   * - **User confidence**: Users can see that the system is working
   *
   * **Important Implementation Notes:**
   * - If using a TaskProgressTracker, the **caller must manage beginning and finishing subtasks**
   * - The default EmptyProgressTracker requires no task management
   * - Progress tracking has minimal performance overhead but provides significant UX value

   * - **Concurrent processing**: Multiple threads processing different property batches
   * - **I/O parallelism**: Overlapping computation with I/O operations
   * - **Resource utilization**: Better use of multi-core systems and I/O bandwidth
   * - **Scalability**: Near-linear speedup for I/O-bound operations
   *
   * **Performance Considerations:**
   * - **Optimal concurrency** depends heavily on the target system characteristics
   * - **File I/O**: Limited by disk bandwidth and seek times
   * - **Network I/O**: Limited by bandwidth and connection pooling
   * - **Database writes**: Limited by transaction throughput and locking
   * - **Memory usage**: Each thread may buffer data, increasing memory requirements
   *
   * **Concurrency Guidelines:**
   * - Start with 2-4 threads and measure performance
   * - Too much concurrency can cause contention and reduce performance
   * - Consider the target system's capabilities and limitations
   * - Monitor memory usage and adjust batch sizes accordingly

   * - **Pipeline processing**: Results immediately available for next algorithm in sequence

   * - **Rollback scenarios**: Keep results in memory in case export needs to be undone
   * - **Performance optimization**: Avoid re-reading exported data immediately after writing
   * - **Development/testing**: Quick access to results for debugging and validation
   *
   * **Memory Management:**
