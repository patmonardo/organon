# gds Config Reports

This folder contains tools for generating reports about configuration types in `gds/src`.

- `config_inventory.csv` — CSV generated by the scanner (path,struct,derive flags, builder, validate, usages).
- `generate_summary.py` — small script that reads the CSV and prints a brief summary.

Usage:

1. Generate the CSV with the provided scanner (or run the script used by the developer assistant).
2. Run `python3 generate_summary.py` to get a quick overview.
