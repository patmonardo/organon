# Absolute Knowing — unifying Ideal (models) and Real (observations)

Intent
- A system-level stance: the “One” that sublates Idealism (models) and Realism (observations) into a single, navigable knowledge surface.
- Practically: delivered by Lenses over canonicalized GraphArtifacts, with Facets expressing provenance and modality.

Mapping to GDSL primitives
- GraphArtifact (Real): canonicalized facts, edges, and counts.
- Facets/Signatures (Context): tokens for provenance, modality (observed/inferred/predicted), confidence.
- Topic (Concept): curated term sets as tools (glossary, index, find).
- Lens (View): projections that co-present Real + Ideal (e.g., overlay observed facts with inferred relations).
- CanonRules (Duty): pure, idempotent dataset-time transforms; document obligations/invariants.

Invariants
- Canon first: all views/Lenses operate on validated GraphArtifacts.
- Provenance preserved: derivations must not erase inputs; provenance is facetized.
- Views are explicit: Lenses declare what they include/omit (no hidden magic).

Non-goals (for now)
- No runtime metaphysics in core exports.
- No engine coupling: @gds algorithms remain separate; @gdsl provides views and tools.

Next
- Keep this concept doc as guidance.
- Later: add a Knowledge Lens that overlays observed + inferred facts (behind a flag).
