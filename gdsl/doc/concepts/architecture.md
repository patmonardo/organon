# GDSL Architecture (high level)

- Registry (king): types, IDs, validators, policies, versioning.
- Adapters: LOGIC/REALITY → DatasetUnit; Unit → Graph.
- Compilers (later): clauses → IR → Essence → Form.
- Policies: speculative/curative control validators/compilers.
- Manifests/Profiles: select units and targets per build.
- GraphStore: persistence; Registry shapes nodes/edges.
