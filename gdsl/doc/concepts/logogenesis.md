# Logogenesis — Conjunction → Hypothetical → Disjunction → Categorical

Intent
- Encode the cognitive cycle (Ignorance → Knowledge → …), where Truth (categorical) reveals the cycle via provenance, and the cycle reconstitutes Truth.

Operationalization
- Conjunction: HAS ∧ IMPLIES
- Hypothetical: derive ONE_OF
- Disjunction: eliminate via NEGATED to select
- Categorical: ACCEPT with modality=inferred and provenance.sources

Invariants
- Idempotence: applying rules twice = once.
- Closure: provenance on ACCEPT reconstructs sufficient sources to re-derive the same ACCEPT.
- Preservation: provenance/modality never dropped by canon rules.
