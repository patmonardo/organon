# 0003 — Absolute Relation and Backpropagation in FormProcessor

- Status: Proposed

- Owners: @organon/logic

## Context
Backpropagation is the action of Ground inside Essence. Morph (Being‑for‑self) is Ground energized in the processor; its truth is Relation (EssentialRelation). Context (Existence) is Reflection (Determinations) that decides contradiction and what falls to ground.

## Decision
- Treat Essential/Absolute Relation as the truth of Morph (Ground), carrying constraint semantics and enabling two‑way propagation (effects may be asymmetric).
- Constrain propagation to the Essence graph (Entities/Properties/Relations) under a fixed Context; principles are inputs (“dead being”) per run.
- Property variations are tied to { contextId, contextVersion } and invalidated on Context version change.

## Consequences
- Morph shapes admissible constructions (Ground) and induces Essential Relations; it remains a principle (no concurrent mutation).
- Backpropagation = constraint propagation along Essential Relations (Ground of experience).
