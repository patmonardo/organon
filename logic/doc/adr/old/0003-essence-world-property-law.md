# ADR 0003: World as Truth of Thing (Property Law Engine)

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-08-17

## Context
- In Appearance, the World is the truth of the Thing. Properties are contextualized by World.
- We model this via a Property-Law engine: Law of Appearance governs property aggregation and conflict.

## Decision
- Introduce a World/Property Law engine that:
  - Aggregates properties across contexts for a Thing.
  - Applies precedence and conflict rules (reflective series within a World).
  - Surfaces a world-state suitable for projections and indexes.

## Consequences
- Deterministic, explainable property outcomes per World.
- Alignment with Hegelian “Truth of Thing” via contextual property law.
