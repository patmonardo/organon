# 0005 — Axiomatic Container (Acromatic Being) vs. Dharmic Contained (Concrete Existence)

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2025-08-14
- Owners: @organon/logic

## Context
- Container Logic (Principles) = Acromatic/Axiomatic Being given as inputs to processing.
- Shape/Context/Morph are axiomatic principles of Essential Being; they “consume” Acromatic Being as fixed inputs (“dead being”) per run.
- Contained Logic (Essence/Appearance) = Concrete Existence governed by dharmas:
  - Entity, Property, Relation are the operative dharmas that determine experience.
  - Entities presuppose mathematical parameters (space/time limits).
  - Gödel-style limitations bind the axiomatic/arithmetical sphere of the Contained, not the Container as such.

## Decision
- Treat Shape/Context/Morph as Axiomatic Principles: inputs to the processor, non-concurrent, versioned, composable.
- Treat Entity/Property/Relation as Dharmic Contained: mutable/concurrent, subject to quantitative/logical limits and propagation.
- Processor executes only over E/P/R under a fixed snapshot of principles; principles remain invariant during a run.

## Consequences
- Formal results (propagation, derivation) live in the Contained; constraints and incompleteness phenomena pertain there.
- Absolute/Essential Relations encode constraint-bearing ties; backpropagation operates along them.
- Context version changes invalidate E/P/R variations; recomputation proceeds under new ground.

## Notes
- “Axiomatic” names the role of Shape/Context/Morph as principles; “Acromatic” marks their independence from the colored content of experience.
- This separation preserves Absolute Knowing at the level of principles while acknowledging mathematical limits in the domain
