# Essence / Reflection / Ground (Qualitative Logic)

Intent
- Frame Entity, Property, Relation (E/P/R) as Essence articulated through Reflection and grounded in experienced structure.

Sketch
- Essence (E): the determinate content (Entities) derived from Principles.
- Reflection (R): differentiations that yield Properties and their measures.
- Ground (G): necessary ties among Entities via Relations (typed, directed, constrained).

Implications
- Concurrency belongs to E/P/R; Principles (Shape/Context/Morph) guide but do not mutate concurrently.
- Property requires key and contextId (measure within a Context).
- Relation requires typed endpoints and kind (grounding determinations).

Next steps
- Formalize E/R/G patterns as constraints over schemas.
- Keep the Processor speculative for now; evolve from schema+services outward.
- Document exemplars: minimal Context + Morph inducing a set of Relations among Entities.
