# Reflective Consciousness (Citta) — positing · external · determining

This note translates Hegel’s three reflections into engine signals we can compute without changing schemas. It complements ADR 0009 (Thing as Vastu).

- Positing reflection: intrinsic determinations from essence/shape and stable properties.
  - Signals: schema/core fields, essential properties (low variance), identity/type coherence.
- External reflection: determinations that appear only in relation-to-others under a Context.
  - Signals: contextual properties, contingent relations, measurements/events.
- Determining reflection: the return-through-mediation that consolidates necessity.
  - Signals: derived judgments/syllogisms, invariants, conservation rules, truth actualization confi­dence.

Processor sketch (no schema change):

- deriveReflectiveFacets(thing, world, ctx) → { positing, external, determining, evidence }
- computeVastuSignature(thing, essentials) → stable hash for idempotence across contexts/time.

Two Truths interface per Thing:

- Appearance view: what shows under Context via properties/relations (Relative Truth).
- Reason view: what follows by form (judgment/syllogism) with confidence (Absolute Truth).

Time (the “three times”) remains a function of Context/World horizons and provenance, not a Thing field.
