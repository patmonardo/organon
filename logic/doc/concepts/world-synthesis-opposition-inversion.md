title: World Synthesis — Opposition and Inversion (Concept Study)
---

What this captures
------------------

- The world‑in‑itself is totality; inside it resides absolute negativity (form) → negative self‑reference, opposition within.
- Totality splits as posited (appearance) and essential (in‑itself). Their identity is an essential connection of opposition.
- The essential world is the inversion of the world of appearance.

Engine perspective
------------------

- From AppearanceWorld (W_app) + Law±, construct:
  - OppositionGraph: edges A ↮ B where law sides contain/repel each other; unify via shared terms into a connected structure.
  - InversionIndex: map each appearance determination x to essential counterpart x^† via law normalization and opposition closure.
  - EssentialWorld (W_ess): totalized essential content graph with explicit Opposition and Inversion edges.
  - WorldDual: binder app↔ess, asserting identity as opposition, carrying signatures and evidence.

Heuristics & signals
--------------------

- Use reflect determining scores to weight edges of opposition and inversion confidence.
- Law confidence and proof status influence inversion selection when multiple candidates exist.
- Temporal windowing required for stability; include in all signatures.

Contracts (recap)
-----------------

- buildOppositionGraph(lawpm) → OppositionGraph
- buildInversionIndex(W_app, lawpm, OG) → InversionIndex
- deriveEssentialWorld(W_app, lawpm, OG, Inv) → EssentialWorld
- bindWorlds(W_app, W_ess, Inv) → WorldDual

Jñānavijñāna note
------------------

- Vyakta (manifest) vs. Avyakta (unmanifest) reconciled as identity via opposition; inversion expresses the recognition that the essential (true concrete existence) is not beyond but the reflected truth of the manifest.
