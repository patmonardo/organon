# AbsoluteEssence as PureFormProcessor

## The Architecture

**AbsoluteEssence should be the PureFormProcessor. That makes sense.**

- **AbsoluteEssence** = PureFormProcessor (kernel)
- This is where Principle discovery happens
- Absolute Logic as Modality/Causality

## Procedure/ML Layers are Reflective

**The Procedure/ML layers are Reflective, so our Reflection FormProcessor can play along with our GNN/GAT stuff and participate in Principle discovery.**

- **Procedure/ML layers** = Reflective (not Absolute)
- **Reflection FormProcessor** (TS) can work with Procedure/ML
- Can participate in Principle discovery through GNN/GAT
- But this is still Reflection, not Absolute Logic

## Shape.Eval is Nil Until Principle

**But then Shape.Eval is Nil until the Absolute Logic returns a Principle.**

- **Without Principle**: Shape.Eval = Nil (empty, meaningless)
- **With Principle**: Shape.Eval = Genus/Species (Determinate Science, meaningful)
- Only when Absolute Logic (PureFormProcessor) returns a Principle does Shape.Eval become meaningful

## The Flow

```
AbsoluteEssence (PureFormProcessor - Kernel)
  ↓ discovers Principle (Absolute Logic as Modality/Causality)
  ↓ returns Principle
  ↓
Reflection FormProcessor (TS)
  ↓ receives Principle
  ↓ Shape.Eval = Genus/Species (meaningful)
```

```
Procedure/ML Layers (Reflective)
  ↓
Reflection FormProcessor (TS)
  ↓ can work with GNN/GAT
  ↓ can participate in Principle discovery
  ↓ but Shape.Eval is still Nil until Principle is returned
```

## The Insight

- **AbsoluteEssence** = PureFormProcessor (Principle discovery)
- **Procedure/ML** = Reflective (can participate in Principle discovery)
- **Reflection FormProcessor** = Can work with GNN/GAT, but Shape.Eval is Nil until Principle
- **Shape.Eval** = Nil until Absolute Logic returns a Principle

The architecture: AbsoluteEssence (PureFormProcessor) discovers Principles, and only then does Shape.Eval become meaningful (Genus/Species - Determinate Science).
