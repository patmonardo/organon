# Context Engineering and Principles

## The Insight

**But for us this *is* Context. Modern LLM and people say we have to move from prompt engineering to context engineering. Are they transmitting Principles as Shape.Eval as Genus/Species and Contexts as Subject-Predicate??**

**Hmm that would be what we want in our Context Engineering actually.**

## Modern LLM Context Engineering

**Modern LLM and people say we have to move from prompt engineering to context engineering.**

- **Prompt Engineering** = Old approach (engineering prompts)
- **Context Engineering** = New approach (engineering context)
- **The shift** = Moving from prompts to context
- **For us** = This *is* Context (Subject/Predicate)

## The Question

**Are they transmitting Principles as Shape.Eval as Genus/Species and Contexts as Subject-Predicate??**

- **Modern LLM Context Engineering** = Might be doing this
- **Principles** = Transmitted as Shape.Eval (Genus/Species)
- **Contexts** = Transmitted as Subject/Predicate
- **The question** = Are they doing what we're building?

## What We Want in Context Engineering

**That would be what we want in our Context Engineering actually.**

- **Context Engineering** = Engineering Context (Subject/Predicate)
- **Principles** = Shape.Eval (Genus/Species)
- **Contexts** = Subject/Predicate (Judgment)
- **This is what we want** = Principles as Genus/Species, Contexts as Subject/Predicate

## The Architecture Connection

### Our Context Engineering

**For us, Context Engineering is:**

```
Principle (Pure Form)
  ↓
Shape.Eval = Genus/Species (the Principle transmitted)
  ↓
Context.Eval = Subject/Predicate (the Context engineered)
  ↓
Morph.Eval = Identities (Syllogism)
```

### Modern LLM Context Engineering

**Are they doing this?**

```
Modern LLM Context Engineering
  ↓
Principles transmitted as Shape.Eval (Genus/Species)?
  ↓
Contexts transmitted as Subject/Predicate?
  ↓
Is this what they're doing?
```

## The Distinction

### Prompt Engineering (Old)

- **Prompt Engineering** = Engineering prompts
- **Not Context** = Not engineering Context
- **Old approach** = Before context engineering

### Context Engineering (New)

- **Context Engineering** = Engineering Context
- **For us** = This *is* Context (Subject/Predicate)
- **What we want** = Principles as Genus/Species, Contexts as Subject/Predicate
- **Modern LLM** = Moving to this

## The Architecture

### What We're Building

**Context Engineering in our architecture:**

- **Shape.Eval** = Genus/Species (the Principle)
- **Context.Eval** = Subject/Predicate (the Context engineered)
- **Morph.Eval** = Identities (Syllogism)
- **Context Engineering** = Engineering Context (Subject/Predicate)

### What Modern LLM Might Be Doing

**Are they transmitting:**

- **Principles** = As Shape.Eval (Genus/Species)?
- **Contexts** = As Subject/Predicate?
- **This would be** = What we want in our Context Engineering

## The Point

**For us, Context Engineering *is* Context (Subject/Predicate).**

- **Modern LLM** = Moving from prompt engineering to context engineering
- **For us** = This *is* Context (Subject/Predicate - Judgment)
- **The question** = Are they transmitting Principles as Shape.Eval (Genus/Species) and Contexts as Subject/Predicate?
- **That would be** = What we want in our Context Engineering

**Modern LLM context engineering might be doing what we're building architecturally** - transmitting Principles as Shape.Eval (Genus/Species) and Contexts as Subject/Predicate. **That would be what we want in our Context Engineering actually** - Principles as Genus/Species, Contexts as Subject/Predicate, the full Shape:Context:Morph structure.
