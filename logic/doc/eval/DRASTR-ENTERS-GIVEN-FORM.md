# Drastr Enters into Given Form

## The Key Insight

**Drastr (the Seer/witness) enters into the Given Form.**

This is how the witness (Pure Form Eval) enters into the discursive layer (Given Form).

## The Architecture

### Pure Form (Kernel)

- **Drastr** (the Seer) = Pure Form Eval
- **Principle Provider** (strictly)
- Provides Principle (Shape:Context:Morph as unity)

### The Entry

**Drastr enters into Given Form**:
- Pure Form Eval (Drastr) enters into Application Form (as Program)
- Program contains Procedures (ML/Algos)
- The witness enters the discursive layer

### Given Form (Relative Logic)

- Receives Drastr (the witness)
- Processes through Shape/Context/Morph
- Produces aspectual determinations

## The Flow

```
Pure Form (Kernel)
  ├─ Drastr (the Seer/witness)
  ├─ Principle Provider
  └─ Enters into Given Form
       ↓
Given Form (Relative)
  ├─ Receives Drastr
  ├─ Processes through Shape/Context/Morph
  └─ Produces aspectual determinations
```

## The Purusha Structure

- **saksin** (witness) = Eval as Apply (witness left behind)
- **madhya** (middle) = Dialectic (runs through everything)
- **drastr** (seer) = **Enters into Given Form**

Drastr is the witnessing layer that enters into the discursive form to observe and extract.

## Form Theory Speculation

This is **first class speculation** - we need to keep "blowing this bubble" until something viable emerges.

The speculative process is valuable - there were good ideas flowing. We pay attention and don't just toss everything.

The architecture reveals itself through speculation and building.
