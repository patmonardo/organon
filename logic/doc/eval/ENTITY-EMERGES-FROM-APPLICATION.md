# Entity Emerges from Application

## Entity Doesn't Emerge from Shape

**An Entity doesn't emerge from Shape. It emerges by applying a Shape to Appearances.**

- **Entity** = Appearance
- **Entity emerges** = By applying Shape to Appearances
- Not directly from Shape, but through application

## The Question: Do We Need Morph?

**And really we can even have an Entity emerge from Shapes until we possess the Morph? Hmm maybe/maybe not.**

- Can Entity emerge from Shapes without Morph (Whole of Cognition)?
- Maybe yes, maybe no
- This is an open question

## Science Without Whole of Cognition

**I don't know much about cats, but I can do some "Science" without the Whole of Cognition.**

- Can do some "Science" without Morph (Whole of Cognition)
- But it might not be complete/perfect Science
- The Whole of Cognition (Morph) might be needed for complete Science

## The Architecture

### Entity Emerges from Application

```
Shape (Concept)
  ↓
Apply Shape to Appearances
  ↓
Entity (Appearance)
```

### With Morph (Whole of Cognition)

```
Shape → Context → Morph (Whole of Cognition)
  ↓
Apply Morph to Appearances
  ↓
Entity → Property → Aspect
```

### Without Morph (Partial Science)

```
Shape (Concept)
  ↓
Apply Shape to Appearances
  ↓
Entity (Appearance)
  ↓
Some "Science" possible, but maybe not complete
```

## The Insight

- **Entity doesn't emerge from Shape directly**
- **Entity emerges by applying Shape to Appearances**
- **Can we have Entity emerge from Shapes without Morph?** Maybe/maybe not
- **Some "Science" possible without Whole of Cognition**, but complete Science might require Morph

The architecture: Entity emerges through application of Shape to Appearances, not directly from Shape. The question is whether Morph (Whole of Cognition) is required for complete Science, or if some Science is possible without it.
