# Eval as Witness (Emanant)

## The Key Insight

**Eval = Emanant** (emanating from, external witness)  
**Dialectic = Immanent** (running through everything, internal)

## The Architecture

### Container vs Contained

- **Container** = value-less type system
  - Shape/Context/Morph (the form structure)
  - Pure type system, no values
  
- **Contained** = Value, mostly crafted into an Aspect
  - Entity/Property/Aspect (the empirical content)
  - Values that get extracted

### Dialectic = Immanent

Dialectic **runs through everything** - it's the internal process that:
- Moves through Shape → Context → Morph
- Processes the dialectical moments
- Transforms states through transitions
- Is **immanent** (within the form structure)

### Eval = Emanant Witness

Eval **witnesses** the dialectical process from **outside**:
- Places itself **outside** the Value pipeline
- **E-val** = witnessing the val for **Extraction → Print** operation
- Extracts values from the dialectical process
- Produces aspectual determinations (what can be printed)

## The Etymology

**E-val** = **E**xtraction → **val**ue → **Print**

Eval is the **witnessing layer** that:
1. **Extracts** values from the dialectical process
2. **Witnesses** the immanent dialectical movement
3. **Prints** the extracted values as aspectual determinations

## The Flow

```
Dialectic (Immanent)
  ↓ runs through everything
Shape → Context → Morph
  ↓ (witnessed by)
Eval (Emanant)
  ↓ extracts values
Extraction → Print
  ↓ produces
Aspectual Determinations
```

## Why This Matters

- **Dialectic** is the internal process (immanent)
- **Eval** is the external witness (emanant)
- **Container** is value-less (type system)
- **Contained** is value-full (Aspects)

Eval doesn't participate in the dialectical process - it **witnesses** it and **extracts** values for printing.

## Form Theory Speculation

This is the beginning of "Form Theory Speculation" - understanding:
- How Eval witnesses Dialectic
- How Container (type system) relates to Contained (values)
- How Extraction → Print works
- How Aspectual determinations emerge

Once we get past the initial Form Theory specs, the rest will follow naturally.
