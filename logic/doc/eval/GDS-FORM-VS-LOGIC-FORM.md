# GDS Form vs Logic Form

## The Distinction

### GDS Form (Kernel - Pure Form)
- **Location**: `gds/src/form/` and `gds/src/projection/eval/form/`
- **Type**: Transcendental Logic
- **Mode**: Pure Reason
- **Concern**: **Possibility of Content** (what CAN BE)
- **Execution**: Non-discursive (sublingual lawful activity)
- **Output**: TruthSteps (scientific relations)
- **Role**: Makes computation possible

### Logic Form (Relative - Discursive Form)
- **Location**: `logic/src/relative/form/`
- **Type**: Ordinary Logic  
- **Mode**: Abstract Reason
- **Concern**: **Given Content** (what IS)
- **Execution**: Discursive (what can be said, traced, explained)
- **Output**: Aspectual determinations (reflective, situated)
- **Role**: Works with manifested content

## The Boundary

```
GDS Form (Kernel)
  ↓ provides Principle (Shape:Context:Morph as unity)
Logic Form (Relative)
  ↓ recursively descends into
Shape → Context → Morph
  ↓ produces
Aspectual Determinations
```

## Key Insight

- **GDS Form** = Transcendental (makes content possible)
- **Logic Form** = Ordinary (works with given content)

GDS Form provides Principle; Logic Form receives and descends.

## Payload Note

Syllogistic work as GDSL payload is fine - it's just payload. Unused payloads can be ignored until the distinction is clearer.
