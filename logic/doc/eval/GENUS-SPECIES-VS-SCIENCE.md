# Genus/Species vs Science

## The Distinction

**A Hamburger is not a Science, but we call it with Genus/Species.**

- Hamburger/McDonald's is a species of Hamburger
- We can use Genus/Species terminology
- But this doesn't make it a Science

## What Hegel Means by Science

**I don't know what Hegel means. There is no Hamburger Science.**

- Just using Genus/Species terminology doesn't make something a Science
- There needs to be a **Principle** that makes it scientific
- The Principle = Modality/Causality (Absolute Logic)
- Without the Principle, it's just categorization (not Science)

## The Architecture

### Without Principle (Ordinary Categorization)
- Hamburger/McDonald's = Genus/Species (but not Science)
- Can use Genus/Species terminology
- But **Shape.eval is Empty** (meaningless)
- No Principle = No Science

### With Principle (Determinate Science)
- Trigonometry = Genus/Species (Determinate Science)
- Has Principle = Modality/Causality
- **Shape.Eval = Genus/Species** (meaningful)
- Principle makes it scientific

## The Insight

**Using Genus/Species terminology doesn't automatically make something a Science.**

- **Ordinary categorization** (Hamburger/McDonald's) = Can use Genus/Species, but not Science
- **Determinate Science** (Trigonometry) = Has Principle, Genus/Species becomes scientific

The Principle is what makes Genus/Species scientific - without it, it's just ordinary categorization.

## Hegel's Science

Hegel's Science requires:
1. **Principle** (Modality/Causality - Absolute Logic)
2. **Genus/Species** (Concept - Determinate Science)
3. **Whole of Cognition** that flows naturally from the Principle

Without the Principle, there is no Science - just ordinary categorization.
