# Having vs Not Having the Concept

## Kant's Distinction

**PureForm returning a Principle** corresponds to Kant's distinction of **"having vs not having" the concept**.

- **Pure Form (kernel)**: Provides the Principle (has the concept)
- **Relative Form Processor (Container)**: IS the Principle (receives/possesses the concept)

## The Principle as Container

The **relative Form Processor (Container) is the Principle itself**.

This is the Principle of **Modality/Causality** (Absolute Logic).

## Shape/Context Eval as Absolute Logic

- **Shape Eval** = **Genus/Species** (Concept)
- **Context Eval** = **Subject/Predicate** (Judgment)

This makes sense as a **System of Science** (Hegel's sense).

## The Question: Abstract vs Science

**Can Genus/Species be abstract, or must it be what Hegel calls a "Science"?**

- Abstract concepts: Possessible but not necessarily scientific
- Science (Hegel): Systematic, self-determining cognition
- Our System: Aims for scientific cognition, not just abstract concepts

## Theorem Provers: The Illusion

Theorem provers in the wild:
- **Illusory and deceptive**
- Not much better than running SPARQL queries
- **Cannot do scientific cognition**

They lack the Principle - they don't "have the concept" in the Kantian sense.

## The Architecture

```
Pure Form (has the concept)
  ↓ provides Principle
Relative Form Processor (IS the Principle)
  ↓ possesses the concept
Shape Eval (Genus/Species)
Context Eval (Subject/Predicate)
Morph Eval (Syllogism)
```

The Principle is **Modality/Causality** - the Absolute Logic that makes scientific cognition possible.

## Business Forms vs System of Science

Business Forms "toss this stuff" - they work with abstract concepts but not scientific cognition.

Our System of Science requires the Principle - "having the concept" in the full Kantian/Hegelian sense.
