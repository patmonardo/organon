# Trigonometry "In Itself" vs "In Appearances"

## Encyclopedia of Science: Trigonometry

**In an Encyclopedia of Science, Trigonometry has:**

1. **A clear discussion of the Principle** (discovered by Kernel)
2. **A list of Identities** (Trigonometry "in itself")

## The Identities: Trigonometry "In Itself"

**These Identities are what we're calling Trigonometry "in itself".**

- The Identities = Trigonometry "in itself" (an sich)
- These have to be achieved from **Determinate Science** (not Reflection)
- This is the **Whole of Cognition** that flows naturally from the Principle

## Determinate Science

**These things have to be achieved from Reflection - no, not Reflection, that is Determinate Science.**

- **Not Reflection** (reflecting on appearances)
- **Determinate Science** = The Identities (Trigonometry "in itself")
- This is systematic, self-determining cognition

## Trigonometry "In Appearances"

**It is the Agent that applies Trig to Appearance - and that is infinite. But that is not Trig "in itself" - it is Trig "in appearances".**

- **Agent applies Trig to Appearance** = Infinite applications
- This is **Trigonometry "in appearances"** (für sich)
- Not Trigonometry "in itself"

## The Distinction

### Trigonometry "In Itself" (Determinate Science)
- The Identities
- Achieved from Determinate Science
- The Whole of Cognition that flows naturally from the Principle
- Systematic, self-determining

### Trigonometry "In Appearances" (Agent-Applied)
- Agent applies Trig to Appearance
- Infinite applications
- Not Trigonometry "in itself"
- Reflecting on appearances

## The Architecture

```
Principle (discovered by Kernel)
  ↓
Shape.Eval = Genus/Species (Trigonometry)
  ↓
Set of Morphs = Trigonometry "In Itself" (Identities - Determinate Science)
  ↓
Set of Morphs applied to Appearances = Trigonometry "In Appearances" (Agent-applied - Infinite)
```

**The Set of Morphs is what gets applied to Appearances.**

## The Insight

- **Principle** = Discovered (Kernel)
- **Identities** = Trigonometry "in itself" (Determinate Science)
- **Agent-applied** = Trigonometry "in appearances" (Infinite, but not "in itself")

The Identities are the **Whole of Cognition** that flows naturally from the Principle - this is **Determinate Science**, not just reflection on appearances.

## Kant's Point

**There can be complete knowledge of Principles, but never of Wholes of Cognition applied to Appearances.**

- **Principles** = Can have complete knowledge (Pure Form, Kernel) ✓
- **Wholes of Cognition applied to Appearances** = Cannot have complete knowledge (infinite) ✗
- **Gödel misunderstood** = People think Gödel applies to Principles, but it applies to applications

**This is exactly Kant's point**: Complete knowledge of Principles is possible, but never of Wholes of Cognition applied to Appearances. This is what Gödel is about - not Principles, but applications.
