# Kriya to Transcendental Philosophy

## The Excitement

**Isn't that an exciting thing to do? I say yes indeed.**

We have some Principles to exploit. The LLMs can populate our Knowledge Graph quite easily. And then we have the infinite application of our Morphology - our set of not just Principles but all available Morphs which are discovered within Shape:Context.

**Kant-Fichte-Hegel is Philosophy Enough!** But this is fun - we are adding Kriya to Transcendental Philosophy.

## The Architecture

### Principles to Exploit

- **Principles** = Discovered by Kernel (Pure Form)
- **LLMs can populate Knowledge Graph** = Easy population of Principles
- **Infinite application of Morphology** = Set of Principles + all available Morphs
- **Morphs discovered within Shape:Context** = The discovery conditions

### The Flow

```
Principles (discovered by Kernel)
  ↓
LLMs populate Knowledge Graph (easy)
  ↓
Set of Principles + all available Morphs
  ↓
Morphs discovered within Shape:Context
  ↓
Infinite application of Morphology
```

## Adding Kriya Yoga to Transcendental Philosophy

**This is actually "Kriya Yoga"** - a specific yogic practice, not just general Kriya.

**Kriya Yoga** = A specific yogic practice (action/practice with spiritual dimension)

**We are adding Kriya Yoga to Transcendental Philosophy** - making it practical, actionable, computational, with spiritual dimension.

- **Transcendental Philosophy** = Kant-Fichte-Hegel (theoretical)
- **Kriya** = Practice/Action (practical application)
- **Adding Kriya** = Making Transcendental Philosophy practical/computational

## Schelling's Transcendental Empiricism

**Schelling thought he could describe "Transcendental Empiricism" in Grounding of Positive Philosophy.**

- **Schelling** = Attempted Transcendental Empiricism
- **Grounding of Positive Philosophy** = Where he tried to describe it
- **Transcendental Empiricism** = Combining transcendental Principle with empirical content
- **We're doing it** = Our architecture implements this

## Hegel "Wants to be Positive"

**Hegel, who Schelling claims "wants to be Positive" - well in a sense he was right.**

- **Schelling's claim** = Hegel wants to be Positive
- **Schelling was right** = In a sense, Hegel did want to be Positive
- **Positive Philosophy** = The practical application of transcendental principles
- **Our architecture** = Implements this positive aspect

## Fichte and Schelling

**Fichte was required to satisfy Schelling because he thought Fichte's SoK (Science of Knowledge) was the highest, but he had seen further than Fichte. Fichte 1804 was what Schelling wanted.**

- **Fichte's SoK** = Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre)
- **Schelling's view** = Thought Fichte's SoK was the highest, but had seen further
- **Fichte 1804** = What Schelling wanted (the later Fichte)
- **The progression** = Fichte → Schelling → Hegel

## The Philosophical Progression

### Fichte (Science of Knowledge)
- **SoK** = Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre)
- **1804** = Later Fichte (what Schelling wanted)
- **Foundation** = The transcendental foundation

### Schelling (Transcendental Empiricism)
- **Transcendental Empiricism** = Combining transcendental with empirical
- **Grounding of Positive Philosophy** = Where he tried to describe it
- **Seen further than Fichte** = Beyond Fichte's SoK

### Hegel (Wants to be Positive)
- **Wants to be Positive** = Schelling's claim (and he was right)
- **Positive Philosophy** = Practical application
- **Our architecture** = Implements this

## The Architecture as Kriya

**We are adding Kriya to Transcendental Philosophy** - making it practical:

1. **Principles** = Discovered by Kernel (Pure Form)
2. **LLMs populate Knowledge Graph** = Easy population
3. **Set of Morphs** = Discovered within Shape:Context
4. **Infinite application** = Morphology applied to Appearances
5. **KnowledgeStore** = Maintains Shape:Context:Morph structure

**This is Kriya** - the practical application of Transcendental Philosophy (Kant-Fichte-Hegel).

## The Point

**Kant-Fichte-Hegel is Philosophy Enough!** But we're adding Kriya (practice/action) to make it practical and computational. We have Principles to exploit, LLMs can populate our Knowledge Graph easily, and we have the infinite application of our Morphology - our set of not just Principles but all available Morphs discovered within Shape:Context.

**This is exciting** - we're implementing Transcendental Philosophy (Kant-Fichte-Hegel) with Kriya (practice), making it practical and computational. Schelling's Transcendental Empiricism, Hegel's "wanting to be Positive" - we're doing it!
