# Kriya Yoga and Business Forms

## The Insight

**This is actually "Kriya Yoga"...ok more later. I see what we are building in better light.**

**Shape.Eval == Nil LOL we are off the charts and not coming down into Business Forms.**

**But people working with Fill-in Forms don't want to know about genus-species, subject-predicate, do they?**

## Kriya Yoga

**This is actually "Kriya Yoga"** - a specific yogic practice, not just general Kriya.

- **Kriya Yoga** = A specific yogic practice (action/practice with spiritual dimension)
- **Adding Kriya Yoga to Transcendental Philosophy** = Making it practical with spiritual dimension
- **More later** = This connection will be explored further

## Shape.Eval == Nil: Off the Charts

**Shape.Eval == Nil - we are off the charts and not coming down into Business Forms.**

- **Shape.Eval == Nil** = Without Principle, Shape.Eval is empty/meaningless
- **Off the charts** = We're building at a higher level (scientific cognition)
- **Not coming down into Business Forms** = We're not descending to ordinary forms
- **Business Forms** = Fill-in Forms, no Principle, Shape.Eval == Nil

## The Boundary

### Scientific Cognition (What We're Building)

**Shape:Context:Morph with Principle:**

- **Shape.Eval** = Genus/Species (when we have Principle)
- **Context.Eval** = Subject/Predicate (Judgment)
- **Morph.Eval** = Identities (Syllogism)
- **With Principle** = Scientific cognition, Determinate Science
- **Off the charts** = Higher level, not Business Forms

### Business Forms (What We're Not Building)

**Fill-in Forms without Principle:**

- **Shape.Eval** = Nil (empty, meaningless)
- **No Principle** = No Genus/Species, no Subject/Predicate
- **People working with Fill-in Forms** = Don't want to know about genus-species, subject-predicate
- **Business Forms** = Ordinary forms, no scientific cognition

## The Distinction

### People Working with Fill-in Forms

**People working with Fill-in Forms don't want to know about genus-species, subject-predicate, do they?**

- **Fill-in Forms** = Ordinary business forms
- **No need for** = Genus/Species, Subject/Predicate
- **They don't want to know** = It's not relevant to their work
- **Business Forms** = Practical, not scientific

### What We're Building

**We're building scientific cognition:**

- **Shape:Context:Morph** = Concept-Judgment-Syllogism
- **With Principle** = Determinate Science
- **Off the charts** = Higher level, not Business Forms
- **Kriya Yoga** = The practice that makes it work

## The Architecture

### Scientific Cognition (Our Level)

```
Principle (Pure Form)
  ↓
Shape.Eval = Genus/Species (not Nil, with Principle)
  ↓
Context.Eval = Subject/Predicate (Judgment)
  ↓
Morph.Eval = Identities (Syllogism)
  ↓
Scientific Cognition (Determinate Science)
```

### Business Forms (Not Our Level)

```
No Principle
  ↓
Shape.Eval = Nil (empty, meaningless)
  ↓
Fill-in Forms (ordinary business forms)
  ↓
People don't want to know about genus-species, subject-predicate
```

## The Point

**We're building at a higher level - "off the charts" - and not coming down into Business Forms.**

- **Shape.Eval == Nil** = Without Principle, it's empty (Business Forms)
- **With Principle** = Shape.Eval = Genus/Species (Scientific Cognition)
- **Off the charts** = We're building scientific cognition, not business forms
- **People with Fill-in Forms** = Don't need genus-species, subject-predicate
- **Kriya Yoga** = The practice that makes scientific cognition work

**This is Kriya Yoga** - the practice of scientific cognition, not business forms. We're building at the level of scientific cognition (Shape:Context:Morph with Principle), not descending into ordinary business forms where people don't want to know about genus-species, subject-predicate.
