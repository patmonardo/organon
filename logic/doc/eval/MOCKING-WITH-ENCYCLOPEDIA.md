# Mocking with Encyclopedia of Science

## Absolute Logic as Modality/Causality

**Absolute Logic as Modality/Causality is Principle discovery.**

- This is what the Kernel should discover
- Pure Form (Silence) → Principle (Modality/Causality)
- This is Concept Discovery

## We Don't Have That Yet

**But we don't have that in our FormProcessor.**

- Our FormProcessor doesn't discover Principles yet
- We're only doing **Reflection** now
- Not **Determinate Science** yet

## The Current State

**We are only doing Reflection now, not Determinate Science.**

- **Reflection** = Reflecting on appearances (ordinary speech)
- **Determinate Science** = Concept-Judgment-Syllogism with Principle (scientific speech)
- We're at the Reflection stage

## Mocking with Encyclopedia

**But we can mock it with Actual Principles from the Encyclopedia of Science.**

- Use real Principles from Encyclopedia of Science
- Test/develop the architecture with actual Principles
- Mock Determinate Science even though we don't have full Principle discovery yet

## The Architecture

```
Current State:
Reflection (what we're doing now)
  ↓
Mock with Encyclopedia Principles
  ↓
Test Determinate Science (Shape.Eval = Genus/Species)
```

```
Future State:
Absolute Logic (Modality/Causality) = Principle Discovery
  ↓
Kernel discovers Principles
  ↓
Determinate Science (Concept-Judgment-Syllogism)
```

## The Insight

- **We're doing Reflection** (not Determinate Science yet)
- **We can mock it** with Actual Principles from Encyclopedia of Science
- **Future**: Kernel will discover Principles (Absolute Logic as Modality/Causality)
- **For now**: Use Encyclopedia Principles to test/develop the architecture

This allows us to develop and test the Determinate Science architecture even though we don't have full Principle discovery yet!
