# Partial Science Example: Trigonometry

## The Example

**I only know about half of the identities of Trig. But I can do some trig. sin² + cos² = 1 is that right? ;-)**

- **sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1** ✓ (Pythagorean identity - correct!)
- Only know about half of the trig identities
- But can still do some trig (Science)

## The Insight

**You can do some Science without the complete Whole of Cognition.**

- **Complete Whole of Cognition** = All trig identities (the Encyclopedia)
- **Partial Science** = Some trig identities (sin² + cos² = 1)
- Can still do Science with partial knowledge

## The Architecture

### With Complete Whole of Cognition (Morph)
```
Shape → Context → Morph (Whole of Cognition - All trig identities)
  ↓
Complete Science (all identities)
```

### With Partial Science (Some Identities)
```
Shape (Concept - Trigonometry)
  ↓
Apply Shape to Appearances
  ↓
Some Science (sin² + cos² = 1, etc.)
  ↓
Partial Science - but still Science!
```

## The Point

- **You don't need all trig identities** to do some trig
- **Some Science is possible** without the complete Whole of Cognition
- **sin² + cos² = 1** is a valid identity - you can use it!
- **Complete Science** might require Morph (Whole of Cognition), but **partial Science** is still possible

This demonstrates that Entity can emerge from Shapes without Morph - you can do some Science (trig) without knowing all the identities (complete Whole of Cognition).
