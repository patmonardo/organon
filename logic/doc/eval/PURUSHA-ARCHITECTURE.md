# Purusha Architecture: Eval as Witness

## Yogic Metaphysics Mapping

**Eval as Apply is a witness left behind** - similar to Yogic metaphysics of **Purusha**.

### Purusha = saksin, madhya, drastr

- **saksin** = witness
- **madhya** = middle = **the dialectic in itself**
- **drastr** = seer = **the witness**

## The Architecture

### Pure Form (Kernel GDS)

**Pure Form as Application Form** - even in GDS, the Kernel Form Eval has to **"enter into"** the Application Form (as Program).

**Form is strictly a Principle Provider** - it provides the Principle (Shape:Context:Morph as unity).

### The Descent

```
Pure Form (Kernel)
  ├─ Principle Provider (Shape:Context:Morph as unity)
  ├─ Form Eval enters into Application Form (as Program)
  └─ Program contains Procedures (ML/Algos)
       ↓
TS Form Eval
  ├─ Handles ML/Algos within the Program
  ├─ Connected to Pure Form Eval descent
  └─ Produces aspectual determinations
```

## The Connection

**Descent into TS Form Eval** would really be connected to **TS Form Eval which handles ML/Algos within the Program**.

The flow:
1. **Pure Form** provides Principle (strictly a Principle Provider)
2. **Pure Form Eval** enters into Application Form (as Program)
3. **Program** contains Procedures (ML/Algos) - Pascally structured
4. **TS Form Eval** handles ML/Algos within the Program
5. The descent connects: Pure Form Eval → TS Form Eval → ML/Algos

## The Witness Structure (Purusha)

- **saksin** (witness) = Eval as Apply (witness left behind)
- **madhya** (middle) = Dialectic (runs through everything - the dialectic in itself)
- **drastr** (seer) = **Enters into Given Form**

**Eval as Apply is a witness left behind** - similar to Yogic metaphysics of Purusha.

**Drastr (the Seer/witness) enters into the Given Form** - this is how the witness enters the discursive layer.

The witness (Drastr) enters into Given Form, observes the middle (Dialectic), and extracts values for printing.

## The Witness Structure

- **saksin** (witness) = Eval as Apply (witness left behind)
- **madhya** (middle) = Dialectic (runs through everything)
- **drastr** (seer) = The witnessing layer (Eval)

Eval witnesses the dialectical process (madhya) and extracts values for printing.

## The Unity

Pure Form provides Principle → enters into Program → Program contains Procedures → TS Form Eval handles Procedures → produces determinations.

The descent maintains the unity while connecting Pure Form Eval to TS Form Eval to ML/Algos.

## Form Theory Speculation

This is the beginning of "Form Theory Speculation" - understanding:
- How Pure Form (Principle Provider) enters into Application Form (Program)
- How Program contains Procedures (ML/Algos) - Pascally structured
- How TS Form Eval handles ML/Algos within the Program
- How the descent connects Pure Form Eval → TS Form Eval → ML/Algos
- How Eval as witness (Purusha) observes the dialectical process

Once we get past the initial Form Theory specs, the rest will follow naturally.
