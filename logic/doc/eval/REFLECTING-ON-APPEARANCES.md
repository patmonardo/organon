# The Logic of Reflecting on Appearances

## The Two-Fold Nature of Principles

**A Principle for us is two-fold:**

1. **The Principle itself** (discovered by Kernel)
2. **The Whole of Cognition that flows naturally from it** (reflected by TS)

**Example: Trigonometry**
- Has a Principle (discovered)
- Has a Whole of Cognition that flows naturally from it (reflected)

## The Logic of Reflecting on Appearances

**What is the Logic of Reflecting on Appearances?**

- This is what the **Relative FormProcessor (TS)** does
- It reflects on appearances (given content)
- It cannot discover the Principle itself
- It can only reflect on what is given

## The Architecture: Why We Need the GDS Kernel

**We only have a Relative FormProcessor (TS) - it cannot uncover/discover Principles.**

- **TS System (Relative FormProcessor)**: Reflecting on Appearances
  - Cannot discover Principles
  - Can only reflect on given content
  - Discursive (what can be said, traced, explained)

**The Procedure/ML system (Rust GDS Kernel) is exactly that - it discovers Principles.**

- **Rust GDS Kernel**: Concept Discovery
  - Discovers Principles (non-discursive)
  - Pure Form (Silence → Principle)
  - Makes cognition possible

**That is why we needed the GDS Kernel.**

## The Flow

```
Rust GDS Kernel (Concept Discovery)
  ↓ discovers Principle
Relative FormProcessor (TS - Reflecting on Appearances)
  ↓ reflects on appearances
  ↓ Whole of Cognition flows naturally from Principle
```

## The Two-Fold Principle

1. **Principle Discovery** (Kernel):
   - Pure Form (Silence)
   - Concept Discovery
   - Non-discursive

2. **Principle Reflection** (TS):
   - Reflecting on Appearances
   - Whole of Cognition flows naturally
   - Discursive

## The Insight

- **TS cannot discover Principles** - it can only reflect on appearances
- **Kernel discovers Principles** - it is Concept Discovery
- **The Whole of Cognition** flows naturally from the Principle once discovered
- **Trigonometry example**: Principle discovered → Whole of Cognition flows naturally

This will be fun once we have the FormProcessors working!
