# Science Works Through Judgment

## The Insight

**All Science Geeks would see the complete List of Trig Identities and want to learn all of them. I see them and I judge, I only need to know half of that. But that is how Science works.**

- **Science Geeks** = Want to learn all trig identities (complete Whole of Cognition)
- **Judgment** = I only need to know half of that
- **This is how Science works** = Through judgment, not completeness

## Science is Not About Completeness

**Science works through judgment - knowing what you need, not knowing everything.**

- **Complete Whole of Cognition** = All trig identities (the Encyclopedia)
- **Judgment** = What you actually need (half of them)
- **Science** = Works through judgment, not completeness

## The Architecture

### Science Through Judgment (What You Need)

## The Point

- **Science is not about completeness** - it's about judgment
- **Judgment** = Knowing what you need (half the identities)
- **Complete Whole of Cognition** = Nice to have, but not necessary
- **Science works** = Through judgment, not through knowing everything

## The Architecture Connection

- **Context Eval** = Judgment (Subject/Predicate)
- **Science works through Judgment** = Context determines what's needed
- **Not about completeness** = You don't need all identities
- **About what's necessary** = Judgment determines what you need

This demonstrates that Science works through **Context (Judgment)** - knowing what you need, not knowing everything. The complete Whole of Cognition (all identities) is nice to have, but Science works through judgment - knowing what's necessary.
