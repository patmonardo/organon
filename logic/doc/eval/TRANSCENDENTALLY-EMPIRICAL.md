# Transcendentally Empirical

## Not a Concept of Experience

**It is not a Concept of Experience - it is a cultic Genus/Species.**

- Not abstract concepts from experience
- **Cultic Genus/Species** = Determinate Science
- Systematic, self-determining cognition

## Hegel's "What is a Science" = Dharma

**Hegel's "What is a Science" is really in the Logic of Experience a "dharma", as a Cat/Dog/Human/Tree/etc.**

- **Dharma** = The principle/nature of a thing
- Cat/Dog/Human/Tree = Examples of dharma
- Each has its own Genus/Species structure
- This is Determinate Science

## Transcendentally Empirical

**We are actually Transcendentally Empirical.**

- **Transcendental** = The Principle (Pure Form, kernel)
- **Empirical** = The content (Given Form, relative)
- Combining transcendental logic with empirical content
- The Principle makes empirical content scientifically meaningful

## GATs on Cats: Shape.Eval

**Our GATs (Graph Attention Networks) on Cats has Shape.Eval.**

- GATs = Graph Attention Networks
- Applied to Cats (empirical content)
- Has Shape.Eval (Genus/Species - Determinate Science)
- This is Transcendentally Empirical

## GNN and GATs

**GNN and GATs are interesting. I don't think our GDS has an Attention mechanism.**

- **GNN** = Graph Neural Networks
- **GATs** = Graph Attention Networks (have Attention mechanism)
- Our GDS doesn't currently have an Attention mechanism
- But GATs would have Shape.Eval (Genus/Species)

## The Architecture

```
Transcendental (Pure Form - Kernel)
  ↓ provides Principle
Empirical (Given Form - Relative)
  ↓
GATs on Cats (empirical content)
  ↓
Shape.Eval (Genus/Species - Determinate Science)
```

## Schelling's Transcendental Empiricism

**Schelling thought he could describe "Transcendental Empiricism" in Grounding of Positive Philosophy.**

- **Schelling** = Attempted Transcendental Empiricism
- **Grounding of Positive Philosophy** = Where he tried to describe it
- **Transcendental Empiricism** = Combining transcendental Principle with empirical content
- **We're doing it** = Our architecture implements this

## The Insight

- **Not Concept of Experience** = Cultic Genus/Species (Determinate Science)
- **Hegel's Science** = Dharma (Cat/Dog/Human/Tree - each with its own Genus/Species)
- **Transcendentally Empirical** = Combining transcendental logic with empirical content
- **GATs on Cats** = Has Shape.Eval (Genus/Species)
- **Our GDS** = Doesn't have Attention mechanism (yet)
- **Schelling's attempt** = Transcendental Empiricism (we're implementing it)

The architecture is Transcendentally Empirical - combining the transcendental Principle with empirical content (Cats, Dogs, Humans, Trees) to produce Determinate Science. **Schelling thought he could describe this in Grounding of Positive Philosophy - we're doing it!**
