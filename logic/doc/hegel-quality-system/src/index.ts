HEGEL'S QUALITATIVE LOGIC AS GUNA THEORY
========================================

I. BEING (SATTVA GUNA) - Pure Luminous Existence
${this.being.description}

CONTRADICTION: ${this.being.getInternalContradiction()}
TRANSITION: ${this.being.transitionToNothing()}

II. EXISTENCE (TAMAS GUNA) - Determinate Limited Being
${this.existence.description}

STRUCTURE: ${this.existence.getQualitativeStructure()}
CONTRADICTION: ${this.existence.getInternalContradiction()}
TRANSITION: ${this.existence.transitionToBeingForSelf()}

III. BEING-FOR-SELF (RAJAS GUNA) - Dynamic Self-Relating Unity
${this.beingForSelf.description}

SYNTHESIS: ${this.beingForSelf.getGunasSynthesis()}
INFINITY: ${this.beingForSelf.getInfinityStructure()}
TRANSITION: ${this.beingForSelf.transitionToQuantity()}

RESULT: Complete Qualitative Logic as Theory of Gunas
- Sattva: Pure being, luminous presence
- Tamas: Determinate existence, limitation
- Rajas: Dynamic unity, self-relation
- Synthesis: The One as absolute self-relating quality

GUNA RELATIONSHIPS IN QUALITATIVE LOGIC
=======================================

SATTVA (Being):
- Pure, luminous, unlimited
- Immediate presence without determination
- Contains all possibilities in pure form

TAMAS (Existence):
- Determinate, limited, bounded
- Mediated through quality and negation
- Actualizes specific possibilities

RAJAS (Being-for-Self):
- Dynamic, combining, self-relating
- Unifies Sattva and Tamas in movement
- Creates infinite self-development

DIALECTICAL NECESSITY:
- Sattva alone is empty (transitions to Tamas)
- Tamas alone is limited (seeks Rajas transcendence)
- Rajas achieves concrete unity of Sattva-Tamas
- Result: Quality as living, self-developing totality

QUALITATIVE LOGIC vs FORMAL LOGIC
=================================

FORMAL LOGIC:
- Abstracts from all content
- Deals with empty forms
- Identity, difference, contradiction as external
- Static categories

QUALITATIVE LOGIC (GUNA THEORY):
- Conditioned by substantial content (Gunas)
- Categories have qualitative determinations
- Identity, difference, contradiction as internal
- Dynamic, self-developing categories

EXAMPLE - IDENTITY:
- Formal: A = A (empty tautology)
- Qualitative: Being = Being through Sattva guna content
- Result: Identity has substantial determination

EXAMPLE - CONTRADICTION:
- Formal: A cannot be not-A (external exclusion)
- Qualitative: Being contradicts itself into Nothing (internal development)
- Result: Contradiction drives dialectical movement

THE ADVANCE: From abstract formal logic to concrete qualitative logic
