 * 4. MVC makes Absolute Unconditioned → Relative Unconditioned (Kant's Practical Pure Reason)
 * 5. We remain in Objective Logic but make it actionable/dharmic
 * 6. MVC becomes the Logic of Experience - where pure thought becomes actionable thought
 * 7. The Agent is crucial - it's the locus of transformation from theoretical to practical
 * 8. This is more profound than traditional MVC - it's a dharmic logic system
