API (TypeDoc HTML)
- ./api/index.html

ADRs (current)
- ./adr/0001-absolute-form-core.md — Absolute/core as the Absolute Form (Contracts, Kriya, Action, Engine). Root is non-transactional; it dispatches canonical objects.
- ./adr/0002-noumenon-phenomenon-bridge-drivers.md — Drivers as positive noumenals mapping Shape/Context/Morph → Entity/Property/Relation; ActiveShape/ActiveContext/ActiveMorph → ActiveEntity/ActiveProperty/ActiveTruth.
- ./adr/0003-essence-world-property-law.md — World as Truth of Thing; Law of Appearance as a Property-Law engine; contextualized properties within World.
- ./adr/0004-container-contained-particularity.md — Absolute ↔ Particulars via `particularityOf`; invariants, backprop hints, and Absolute scoping.
- ./adr/0005-active-truth-and-active-ground.md — EssentialRelation as ActiveTruth (preferred over “ActiveRelation”); ActiveGround aggregation; thresholds, provenance, invariants.
- ./adr/0006-kriya-orchestration-and-root-boundaries.md — Seed→Contextualize→Reflect→Ground→Action→Model→Control→Plan; non-transactional Root vs transactional triads.
- ./adr/0007-processor-contracts-and-schema-boundaries.md — ProcessorInputs/ProcessorSnapshot boundaries; schema primacy; Form wrappers and processor guarantees.

ADRs (archive)
- ./adr/old — legacy ADRs retained for reference.
