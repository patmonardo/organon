# AbsoluteForm: E/R/G inside a Fixed Context

Intent
- Run Essence / Reflection / Ground under a fixed snapshot of principles (“dead being” inputs).
- Map the qualitative triad (Being, Existence, Being‑for‑self) into Essence’s truths.

Dialectic mapping
- Being → Shape as Essential Being (Shape operates in the Sphere of Essence as the truth of Becoming).
- Existence → Context as Reflection (Determinations of Reflection: decides contradiction and what falls to ground).
- Being‑for‑self → Morph as Ground (energized in the processor; “Active Ground”).

Truths inside Essence (Appearance/Quantitative)
- Relation = Truth of Morph (EssentialRelation; Ground of experience; constraint carrier).
- Property = Truth of Reflection (measured determinations within Context).
- Entity = Truth of Being (determinate content).

Rules
- Being as Input: principles (Shape, Context, Morph) are snapshotted and not mutated during a run.
- Context immunity: Property variations never mutate Context; version changes invalidate variations.
- Ground governance: Absolute/Essential Relations propagate constraints on the Essence graph; possibly two‑way, not necessarily symmetric.

Processor sketch
- Snapshot principles (Shape, Context, Morph) → build Essence graph (Entity, Property, Relation) → apply Morph (as Ground) to induce/validate Essential Relations → propagate until fixpoint → emit results with Context provenance.
