# E/R/G in Context (Inputs from Being, Control in Essence)

Thesis
- Essence / Reflection / Ground (E/R/G) operate inside the Sphere of Essence.
- The Sphere of Being provides inputs (“dead being”) that Essence consumes and determines.
- Context governs E/R/G as fixed principle (versioned, immune to concurrent mutation) without being altered by Property variations.

Mapping
- Essence (E) → Entities: determinate content within a fixed Context.
- Reflection (R) → Properties: measured determinations of Entities, parameterized by Context.
- Ground (G) → Relations: necessary ties among Entities; Absolute Relations propagate constraints.
- Being → Input: Shape/Context/Morph as principles from the Sphere of Being are received and fixed as inputs to Essence during processing.

Operational rules
- Context is versioned; Property variations include { contextId, contextVersion } and are invalidated on Context change.
- Backpropagation = constraint propagation along Absolute Relations over the Essence graph under a fixed Context snapshot.
- Morph does not mutate; it shapes admissible constructions (principle) while Ground is realized in processing.

Processor stance
- Snapshot Principles (Shape/Morph/Context) → build Essence graph (E/P/R) → propagate until fixpoint → emit results with Context provenance.
- If Context cycloid occurs (version bump), discard prior Property variations and recompute.

Notes
- “Drowning in the quality of Existence” is localized: the richness lives in Essence (E/P/R) under the qualitative law of Context (E/R/G as soul).
