# Essential Relation — Truth of Morph (Ground of Experience)

Definition
- EssentialRelation is Relation as the truth of Morph (Being‑for‑self realized as Ground). It carries constraints that bind Entities under a Context.

Properties
- Typed, directed refs; may be absolute (constraint‑bearing).
- Supports two‑way propagation; effects can be asymmetric.
- Governed by Context (Reflection); invalidated on Context version change.

Processor role
- Morph specifies admissible constructions and induces Essential Relations.
- Propagation runs along Essential Relations until fixpoint; outputs include provenance { contextId, contextVersion }.
