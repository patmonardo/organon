# Force — Parts 2 & 3: Solicitation and Infinity (study notes)

- Solicitation (b):
  - Each force treats its externality as its own positing; stimulus “only solicits.”
  - Active and passive are mediated: A is soliciting iff A is solicited-to-solicit; and vice-versa for B.
  - Therefore pairing is symmetric and internally conditioned; not a one-way push.

- Infinity (c):
  - Force expresses that reference-to-other = reference-to-self.
  - Externality is nothing immediate; it’s mediated by the force’s own negativity and return-to-self.
  - The act is reactive: positing the stimulus is also sublating it.

Contract sketch

- Input to pairing: { id, inwardScore?, outwardScore?, tags? }[]
- Output pairs: { id, a, b, symmetric: true, mediated: true, signature, evidence[] }
- Infinity expression: { pairId, identityScore, signature, evidence[] }

Use-cases

- Provide cheap pairings for Action worldviews; compute identity scores that can seed “world of forces" projections.
