# Morph as Syllogism (Emergence)

Claim
- Morph = Being‑for‑self (Ground) as the active unity of Shape ∧ Context.
- Context defines determinations (Reflection) and the Property catalog (predicates);
  Shape supplies types; Morph composes admissible constructions over Entities as
  instances of Shapes under a given Context.

Operation
- Inputs (principles, fixed per run): Shape, Context, Morph definitions.
- Field (essence): Entities (instances), Properties (contextualized), Relations.
- Effect: Morph maps (Shape, Context) → Essential Relations over Entities; may also derive Properties.
- Processor: snapshot principles → instantiate Properties for Entities → apply Morph rules → propagate along Essential Relations to fixpoint.

Notes
- “Morph only on Context:Property?” Practically yes: Morph consumes the Property catalog (from Context) and Shape types to act on Entities and emit Relations.
- Morph remains a principle (non-concurrent); the action lives in E/P/R.
