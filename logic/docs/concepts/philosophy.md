# Philosophical grounding — Fichtean‑Kantian stance (note on Schopenhauer)

Summary
- We treat the Form Processor as an active, transcendental subject (Fichtean), operating on the conditions that make appearance possible (Kantian).
- Avoid treating Morph as mere blind Will (Schopenhauer); reserve that framing for teleology/intent layers only as a cautionary note.

Mappings to architecture
- Kantian: Schemas/Shapes/Contexts = conditions of possibility (categories, forms of judgment). Ring 0 supplies stable contracts (Repository, Id, Clock) analogous to transcendental conditions.
- Fichtean: The Processor (SingleAgent running Rings 1–3) is an active positing ego — it enacts appearances by seeding Entities from Shapes, contextualizing Properties, and grounding Relations. Action, not passive representation, is central.
- Schopenhauer (World as Will and Representation): useful as an image for raw, preconceptual driving forces. In our design this maps to teleological metadata/intent (Ring 2/3) but should not replace deterministic Ground rules (Ring 1). Treat “will” as a userland interpretive layer, not core engine logic.

Practical consequences
- Keep Ground (Ring 1) deterministic, auditable, and principle-driven (Morphs as rule/principle).
- Place purposes/intents, utility, and policy in Concept/Intent layer (Ring 2/3) — this is where teleology and “will-like” notions belong.
- Document provenance and mediation: everything the Processor posits must carry its contextId/contextVersion and ruleId so we can distinguish positing (Fichtean act) from mere appearance.

Next steps
- Add bibliographic notes and short excerpts (Kant, Fichte, Schopenhauer) to docs for reference.
- Mark any Morphs that carry teleological metadata as Concept-linked, not core-ground rules.
