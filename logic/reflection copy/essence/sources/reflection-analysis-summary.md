### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Three-part structure (positing/external/determining) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in determining reflection as unity

### Key Concepts
- **Reflection as movement from nothing to nothing**: Pure negativity, movement that remains within itself
- **Positing reflection**: Immediacy as turning back, no other beforehand, self-repulsion
- **External reflection**: Presupposes being, doubled determination, syllogism structure
- **Determining reflection**: Unity of positing and external, positedness vs. existence, free essentialities
- **Positedness**: Immediacy purely as determinateness, reference to turning back into itself
- **Essential shine**: Determinate shine as it is in essence, determinations as free essentialities
- **Self-equality**: Essence is equality with itself only by sublating equality with itself

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Continue with shine.txt (if it has content) and other Reflection section files
