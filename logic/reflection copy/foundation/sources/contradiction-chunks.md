# Chunking Plan for contradiction.txt - Contradiction

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: Contradiction (294 lines)
- 1. Opposition as self-subsisting — contradiction (lines 4-39)
- Difference implicitly contradiction — posited contradiction (lines 41-57)
- Positive as contradiction (lines 59-80)
- Absolute contradiction of positive and negative (lines 82-130)
- 2. Contradiction resolves itself — null and positive (lines 132-154)
- Immanent reflection — self-subsistence and positedness (lines 156-176)
- Excluding reflection — self-withdrawal, positive self-unity (lines 178-210)
- 3. Transition to ground — opposition foundered (lines 212-236)
- Essence as ground — positedness (lines 238-265)
- Resolved contradiction is ground — unity of positive and negative (lines 267-293)

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Opposition as self-subsisting — contradiction
**Lines**: 4-39
**Title**: Opposition as self-subsisting — contradiction
**Key Points**:
- Difference contains both sides as moments
- In diversity, sides fall apart as indifferent
- In opposition, moments determined by other, only moments
- But in opposition moments equally determined within, mutually exclusive, self-subsisting
- Positive and negative, each such within
- Each has indifferent self-subsistence by virtue of reference to other moment within it
- Each moment is whole self-contained opposition
- Self-mediated through other and through non-being of other
- Unity existing for itself and excluding other from itself
- Self-subsisting determination excludes other in same respect as it contains it
- In self-subsistence, determination excludes its own self-subsistence from itself
- Self-subsistence consists in containing other determination in itself and excluding determination that negates it
- And so it is contradiction

### Chunk 2: Difference implicitly contradiction — posited contradiction
**Lines**: 41-57
**Title**: Difference implicitly contradiction — posited contradiction
**Key Points**:
- Difference as such already implicitly contradiction
- Unity of beings which are, only in so far as they are not one
- Separation of beings which are, only in so far as they are separated in same reference connecting them
- Positive and negative are posited contradiction
- As negative unities, precisely their self-positing
- Each sublating of itself and positing of its opposite
- Constitute determining reflection as exclusive
- Excluding is one act of distinguishing
- Each distinguished being, as exclusive, is whole act of excluding
- Each excludes itself internally

### Chunk 3: Positive as contradiction
**Lines**: 59-80
**Title**: Positive as contradiction
**Key Points**:
- Positive is positedness as reflected into likeness with itself
- Positedness which is not reference to another
- Subsistence inasmuch as positedness is sublated and excluded
- But positive makes itself into reference of non-being into positedness
- Positive is contradiction: positing self-identity by excluding negative, makes itself into negative
- Makes itself into other which it excludes from itself
- Excluded is posited free of one that excludes, reflected into itself and itself as excluding
- Reflection that excludes is positing of positive as excluding other
- This positing immediately is positing of its other which excludes it

### Chunk 4: Absolute contradiction of positive and negative
**Lines**: 82-130
**Title**: Absolute contradiction of positive and negative
**Key Points**:
- Absolute contradiction of positive, immediately absolute contradiction of negative
- Positing of both in one reflection
- Negative is positedness as reflected into unlikeness to itself
- Negative is itself unlike, non-being of another
- Reflection in its unlikeness is reference rather to itself
- Negation as quality or immediate determinateness
- Taken as negative, referred to negative of itself, to its other
- Negative is not immediate
- Since each equally same as what other is, reference connecting them as unequal is identical connection
- Same contradiction as positive: positedness or negation as self-reference
- Positive only implicitly contradiction, contradiction only in itself
- Negative is posited contradiction
- Negative identical with itself, determination is to be not-identical, exclusion of identity
- To be identical with itself over against identity, excludes itself from itself
- Negative is whole opposition, opposition which rests upon itself
- Distinction that absolutely does not refer itself to another
- Excludes identity from itself, but thereby excludes itself
- As reference to itself determines itself as very identity which it excludes

### Chunk 5: Contradiction resolves itself — null and positive
**Lines**: 132-154
**Title**: Contradiction resolves itself — null and positive
**Key Points**:
- In self-excluding reflection, positive and negative, each in self-subsistence, sublates itself
- Each is passing over, self-translating of itself into its opposite
- Internal ceaseless vanishing of opposites is first unity that arises by virtue of contradiction
- It is the null
- But contradiction does not contain merely negative, also contains positive
- Self-excluding reflection is at same time positing reflection
- Result of contradiction is not only null
- Positive and negative constitute positedness of self-subsistence
- Their own self-negation sublates it
- This positedness founders to ground in contradiction

### Chunk 6: Immanent reflection — self-subsistence and positedness
**Lines**: 156-176
**Title**: Immanent reflection — self-subsistence and positedness
**Key Points**:
- Immanent reflection turns sides of opposition into self-subsistent self-references
- First, their self-subsistence as distinct moments
- They are self-subsistence only in themselves, for they are still opposites
- That they are in themselves self-subsistent constitutes their positedness
- But excluding reflection sublates this positedness
- Turns them into self-subsistent beings existing in and for themselves
- Self-subsistent not only in themselves but by virtue of negative reference to their other
- Their self-subsistence also posited
- But by being posited as self-subsistent, they make themselves into positedness
- They fate themselves to founder
- Determine themselves as self-identical, yet in self-identity are rather negative
- Self-identity which is reference-to-other

### Chunk 7: Excluding reflection — self-withdrawal, positive self-unity
**Lines**: 178-210
**Title**: Excluding reflection — self-withdrawal, positive self-unity
**Key Points**:
- Excluding reflection is not only formal determination
- It is self-subsistence existing in itself
- Sublating of positedness is only through this sublating a unity that exists for itself and is self-subsistent
- Through sublating of otherness or positedness, positedness or negative of other present again
- But this negation is not return to first immediate reference to other
- Not positedness as sublated immediacy, but positedness as sublated positedness
- Excluding reflection makes itself positedness but is sublation of its positedness
- Sublating reference to itself
- First sublates negative, secondly posits itself as negative, only this posited negative that it sublates
- In sublating negative, both posits and sublates it at same time
- Exclusive determination is itself that other of itself of which it is negation
- Sublation of positedness is not positedness as negative of other, but self-withdrawal, positive self-unity
- Self-subsistence is unity that turns back into itself by virtue of its own negation
- Turns into itself through negation of its positedness
- Unity of essence to be identical with itself through negation not of other, but of itself

### Chunk 8: Transition to ground — opposition foundered
**Lines**: 212-236
**Title**: Transition to ground — opposition foundered
**Key Points**:
- Since self-subsistence in opposition, as excluding reflection, makes itself into positedness and equally sublates it
- Not only has opposition foundered but in foundering has gone back to foundation, to ground
- Excluding reflection turns self-subsisting opposition into negative, something only posited
- Reduces formerly self-subsisting determinations (positive and negative) to determinations which are only determinations
- Positedness has gone back to its unity with itself
- Simple essence, but essence as ground
- Through sublating of determinations of essence, which are in themselves self-contradictory, essence is restored
- Restored in determination of exclusive, reflective unity
- Simple unity which determines itself as negation, but in positedness is immediately like itself and withdrawn into itself

### Chunk 9: Essence as ground — positedness
**Lines**: 238-265
**Title**: Essence as ground — positedness
**Key Points**:
- Because of contradiction, self-subsisting opposition goes back into ground
- Opposition is what comes first, immediate from which beginning is made
- Sublated opposition or sublated positedness is itself positedness
- Essence is as ground positedness, something that has become
- But conversely, only this has been posited: opposition or positedness is something sublated, only is as positedness
- As ground, essence is excluding reflection because makes itself into positedness
- Opposition from which start was made is merely posited determinate self-subsistence of essence
- Opposition only sublates itself within, whereas essence is in determinateness reflected into itself
- As ground, essence excludes itself from itself, posits itself
- Positedness which is excluded is only as positedness, as identity of negative with itself
- Self-subsistent is negative posited as negative, something self-contradictory
- Remains in essence as in its ground

### Chunk 10: Resolved contradiction is ground — unity of positive and negative
**Lines**: 267-293
**Title**: Resolved contradiction is ground — unity of positive and negative
**Key Points**:
- Resolved contradiction is ground, essence as unity of positive and negative
- In opposition, determinateness has progressed to self-subsistence
- Ground is this self-subsistence as completed
- In it, negative is self-subsistent essence, but as negative
- As self-identical in this negativity, ground is equally positive
- In ground, opposition and its contradiction just as much removed as preserved
- Ground is essence as positive self-identity which refers itself to itself as negativity
- Determines itself, making itself into excluded positedness
- But positedness is whole self-subsisting essence
- Essence is ground, self-identical in its negation and positive
- Self-contradictory self-subsistent opposition was itself already ground
- All that was added was determination of self-unity
- Which emerges as each self-subsisting opposite sublates itself and makes itself into its other
- Founders and sinks to ground but therein reunites itself with itself
- In foundering, in positedness or in negation, rather is for first time essence that is reflected into itself and self-identical
