But conversely, only this has been posited: opposition or positedness is something sublated, only is as positedness. As ground, essence is excluding reflection because makes itself into positedness. Opposition from which start was made is merely posited determinate self-subsistence of essence. Opposition only sublates itself within, whereas essence is in determinateness reflected into itself.
