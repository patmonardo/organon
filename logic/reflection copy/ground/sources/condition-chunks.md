## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: a. The relatively unconditioned — condition as immediate
**Lines**: 6-14
**Title**: a. The relatively unconditioned — condition as immediate
**Key Points**:
- Ground is immediate, grounded is mediated
- But ground is positing reflection, makes itself into positedness
- Is presupposing reflection, refers itself to itself as to something sublated
- To immediate through which it is itself mediated
- Mediation, as advance from immediate to ground, is not external reflection
- Ground's own doing, ground-connection as reflection into self-identity
- Is just as essentially self-externalizing reflection
- Immediate to which ground refers as to its essential presupposition is condition
- Real ground is essentially conditioned

### Chunk 2: Condition — three moments
**Lines**: 22-71
**Title**: Condition — three moments
**Key Points**:
- Condition is, first, immediate, manifold existence
- Second, existence referred to other, to something which is ground
- Not of this existence but in some other respect
- Existence itself is immediate and without ground
- According to reference, something posited
- As condition, immediate existence supposed to be not for itself but for another
- That it is for another is itself only positedness
- That it is posited is sublated in its immediacy
- Existence is indifferent to being condition
- Third, condition is immediate in sense that constitutes presupposition of ground
- In this determination, form-connection of ground withdrawn into self-identity
- Hence content of ground
- Content is only indifferent unity of ground
- Frees itself from indifferent unity in that ground-connection, in complete ground
- Becomes connection external to its identity, whereby content acquires immediacy
- Condition is that in which ground-connection has its identity with itself
- Constitutes content of ground
- But since content indifferent to form, only implicitly content of form
- Something which has yet to become content, constitutes material for ground
- Posited as condition, existence determined to lose indifferent immediacy
- Become moment of another
- By virtue of immediacy, indifferent to connection
- Inasmuch as enters into it, constitutes in-itself of ground
- Is for it unconditioned
- In order to be condition, has presupposition in ground and is itself conditioned
- But condition is external to it

### Chunk 3: Something has condition and ground
**Lines**: 73-113
**Title**: Something has condition and ground
**Key Points**:
- Something is not through its condition, condition is not its ground
- Condition is for ground moment of unconditioned immediacy
- But not itself movement and positing that refers itself to itself negatively
- Over against condition stands ground-connection
- Something has, besides condition, also ground
- Ground is empty movement of reflection
- Has immediacy which is presupposition outside it
- But whole form and self-subsistent process of mediation
- Since mediating refers itself to itself as positing
- Equally is according to this side something immediate and unconditioned
- Presupposes itself, but as externalized or sublated positing
- Whatever it is in accordance with determination, that it is in and for itself
- Ground-connection is self-subsisting self-reference
- Has within it identity of reflection
- Has content peculiarly its own as against content of condition
- One content is that of ground, essentially informed
- Other content, that of condition, only immediate material
- Connecting reference to ground, while constituting in-itself of latter
- Also equally external to it
- Mingling of self-subsisting content that has no reference to content of ground determination
- And content that enters into latter and, as material, should become moment of it

### Chunk 4: Two sides — indifferent and mediated
**Lines**: 115-146
**Title**: Two sides — indifferent and mediated
**Key Points**:
- Two sides of whole, condition and ground
- On one hand, indifferent and unconditioned with respect to each other
- One as non-referred-to side, to which connecting reference is external
- Other as connecting reference, or form, for which determinate existence of condition is only material
- Something passive whose form is unessential
- On other hand, two sides also mediated
- Condition is in-itself of ground
- Essential moment of ground-connection, simple self-identity of ground
- But this also sublated, in-itself only something posited
- Immediate existence indifferent to being condition
- Fact that condition is in-itself of ground constitutes side by which it is mediated condition
- Ground-connection has in self-subsistence also presupposition
- Has its in-itself outside itself
- Each of two sides is contradiction
- Indifferent immediacy and essential mediation, both in one reference
- Contradiction of independent subsistence and being determined as only moments

### Chunk 5: b. The absolutely unconditioned — reflective shine
**Lines**: 150-156
**Title**: b. The absolutely unconditioned — reflective shine
**Key Points**:
- At first, each of two relatively unconditioned sides reflectively shines in other
- Condition, as immediate, reflected in form connection of ground
- Form in immediate existence as its positedness
- But each, apart from reflective shine of other in it, stands out on own
- Has content of own

### Chunk 6: Condition's form — two moments
**Lines**: 158-180
**Title**: Condition's form — two moments
**Key Points**:
- Condition is at first immediate existence
- Form has two moments: positedness, according to which it is material and moment of ground
- And in-itself, according to which constitutes essentiality of ground or simple reflection into itself
- Both sides of form external to immediate existence
- For latter is sublated ground-connection
- But, first, existence is in it only this: sublate itself in immediacy and founder, going to ground
- Being is as such only becoming of essence
- Essential nature to make itself into positedness and identity which is immediacy through negation of itself
- Form determinations of positedness and self-identical in-itself
- Form through which immediate existence is condition
- Are not external to existence, latter is this very reflection

### Chunk 7: Condition as whole form — ground
**Lines**: 182-208
**Title**: Condition as whole form — ground
**Key Points**:
- Second, as condition, being posited as that which essentially is
- Moment and consequently being of other, and at same time in-itself of other
- In itself but only through negation of itself, through ground and self-sublating presupposing reflection
- In-itself of being only something posited
- In-itself of condition has two sides: essentiality as essentiality of ground, immediacy of existence
- Both sides same thing
- Existence is immediate, but immediacy essentially mediated through self-sublating ground
- Existence, as immediacy mediated by self-sublating mediating
- Is at same time in-itself of ground and unconditioned side
- But in-itself equally only moment or positedness, since mediated
- Condition is whole form of ground-connection
- Presupposed in-itself of latter, but consequently itself positedness
- Immediacy is to make itself into positedness and repel itself from itself
- Both founders to ground and is ground
- Ground that makes itself into positedness and thereby into grounded
- Both one and same

### Chunk 8: Conditioned ground — whole itself
**Lines**: 210-224
**Title**: Conditioned ground — whole itself
**Key Points**:
- Likewise in conditioned ground, in-itself not just reflective shining of other in it
- Ground is self-subsistent, self-referring reflection of positing
- Self-identical, in it its in-itself and content
- But at same time presupposing reflection
- Negatively refers to itself, posits in-itself as other opposite to it
- Condition, according to both moment of in-itself and immediate existence
- Is ground-connection's own moment
- Immediate existence essentially only through ground
- Moment of itself as presupposing
- Ground is equally whole itself

### Chunk 9: One whole of form and content
**Lines**: 226-242
**Title**: One whole of form and content
**Key Points**:
- Only one whole of form, equally only one whole of content
- Proper content of condition is essential content only in so far as self-identity of reflection in form
- Or ground-connection is in it immediate existence
- Existence is condition only through presupposing reflection of ground
- Ground's self-identity, or content, to which ground posits itself as opposite
- Existence not formless material for ground-connection
- Because has form in it, informed matter
- In identity with it at same time indifferent to it, is content
- Same content as possessed by ground
- Content as self-identical in form connection

### Chunk 10: One essential unity — absolutely unconditioned
**Lines**: 244-273
**Title**: One essential unity — absolutely unconditioned
**Key Points**:
- Two sides of whole, condition and ground, one essential unity, as content as well as form
- Pass into one another, posit themselves as sublated
- Refer themselves to their negation, reciprocally presuppose each other
- But only one reflection of two, presupposing one presupposing only
- Reciprocity of presupposing amounts to both presuppose one identity
- For subsistence and substrate
- Substrate, one content and unity of form of both, is truly unconditioned
- Fact in itself
- Condition only relatively unconditioned
- Usual to consider as itself conditioned, ask for new condition
- Progression ad infinitum from condition to condition
- But why is condition assumed to be conditioned?
- Because finite determinate existence
- Further determination that does not enter into concept
- Condition as such conditioned solely because posited in-itselfness
- Sublated in absolutely unconditioned

### Chunk 11: Absolutely unconditioned — fact in itself
**Lines**: 275-307
**Title**: Absolutely unconditioned — fact in itself
**Key Points**:
- Absolutely unconditioned contains two sides, condition and ground, as moments
- Unity to which they returned
- Together constitute its form or positedness
- Unconditioned fact is condition of both, but condition which is absolute
- One which is itself ground
- As ground, fact is negative identity repelled into two moments
- First, sublated ground-connection, immediate manifold void of unity
- External to itself, refers to ground as other, constitutes its in-itself
- Second, inner simple form which is ground
- Refers to self-identical immediate as other, determining it as condition
- Determining in-itself as own moment
- Two sides presuppose totality, presuppose it posits them
- Contrariwise, because presuppose totality, latter seems conditioned by them
- Fact springs forth from condition and ground
- But since two sides identity, relation of condition and ground disappeared
- Two reduced to mere reflective shine
- Absolutely unconditioned in movement of positing and presupposing
- Only movement in which shine sublates itself
- Fact's own doing that conditions itself and places itself as ground over against conditions
- In connecting conditions and ground, fact reflection shining in itself
- Relation to them rejoining itself

### Chunk 12: c. Procession — absolutely unconditioned as absolute ground
**Lines**: 311-319
**Title**: c. Procession — absolutely unconditioned as absolute ground
**Key Points**:
- Absolutely unconditioned is absolute ground identical with condition
- Immediate fact as truly essential
- As ground, refers negatively to itself, makes itself into positedness
- Positedness is reflection complete in both sides
- Self-identical form of connection
- Positedness is first sublated ground, fact as immediacy void of reflection
- Side of conditions

### Chunk 13: Conditions — totality of determinations
**Lines**: 320-380
**Title**: Conditions — totality of determinations
**Key Points**:
- Totality of determinations of fact, fact itself
- But fact as thrown into externality of being, restored circle of being
- In condition, essence lets go unity of immanent reflection
- Lets it go as immediacy that carries character of conditioning presupposition
- Essentially constituting only one of sides
- Conditions are whole content of fact
- Unconditioned in form of formless being
- But because of form, have yet another shape besides conditions of content
- Appear as manifold without unity, mingled with extra-essential elements
- For absolute, unrestricted fact, sphere of being itself is condition
- Ground, returning into itself, posits sphere as first immediacy
- Immediacy, as sublated reflection, is reflection in element of being
- Form proliferates as determinateness of being
- Appears as manifold distinct from determination of reflection
- Content indifferent to it
- Unessential determinateness of immediacy into which unity of form sunk
- Unity of form, as connection of being, is becoming, passing over of determinateness
- Becoming of being is coming to be of essence and return to ground
- Existence that constitutes conditions not determined as condition by other
- Not used as material, itself makes itself into moment of other
- Becoming does not start from itself as first and immediate
- Immediacy only presupposed, movement of becoming doing of reflection itself
- Truth of existence is that it is condition
- Immediacy solely by virtue of reflection of ground-connection that posits itself as sublated
- Immediacy essentially only moment of form

### Chunk 14: Ground-connection — form
**Lines**: 382-438
**Title**: Ground-connection — form
**Key Points**:
- Other side of reflective shining is ground-connection as such
- Determined as form as against immediacy of conditions and content
- Form of absolute fact that possesses unity of form with itself or content within it
- In determining content as condition, sublates diversity of content, reduces to moment
- Contrariwise, as form void of essence, gives itself immediacy of subsistence
- Reflection of ground sublates immediacy of conditions
- Connecting them, making moments within unity of fact
- But conditions are that which unconditioned fact presupposes
- Latter sublates own positing, positing converts immediately into becoming
- Two one unity: internal movement of conditions is becoming
- Return into ground and positing of ground
- Ground as posited (sublated) is immediate
- Ground refers negatively to itself, makes itself into positedness, grounds conditions
- In this, immediate existence determined as positedness
- Ground sublates it and only then makes itself into ground
- Reflection is self-mediation of unconditioned fact through its negation
- Reflection of unconditioned is at first presupposing
- Sublating of itself immediately positing which determines
- In positing, immediately sublating of presupposed and determining from within itself
- Determining is sublating of positing: becoming within itself
- Mediation as turning back to itself through negation has disappeared
- Mediation is simple reflection reflectively shining within itself
- Groundless, absolute becoming
- Fact's movement of being posited through conditions and ground
- Is disappearing of reflective shine of mediation
- Process by which fact posited is coming forth
- Simple self-staging of fact in concrete existence
- Pure movement of fact to itself

### Chunk 15: All conditions at hand — concrete existence
**Lines**: 440-489
**Title**: All conditions at hand — concrete existence
**Key Points**:
- When all conditions of fact at hand, fact steps into concrete existence
- Fact is, before exists concretely
- First, as essence or unconditioned
- Second, immediate existence or determined, twofold: conditions and ground
- In former case, given itself form of external, groundless being
- As absolute reflection, negative self-reference, makes itself into presupposition
- Presupposed unconditioned is groundless immediate whose being is to be there, without grounds
- If all conditions at hand, totality posited as groundless immediate
- Scattered manifold internally recollects itself
- Whole fact must be there within conditions
- All conditions belong to concrete existence
- All of them constitutes reflection of fact
- Immediate existence, since condition, determined by form
- Determinations are determinations of reflection
- With positing of one, rest essentially posited
- Recollecting of conditions is foundering to ground of immediate existence
- Coming to be of ground
- Ground is posited ground, to extent ground, to that extent sublated as ground
- Is immediate being
- If all conditions at hand, sublate themselves as immediate existence and presupposition
- Ground equally sublated
- Latter proves only reflective shine that immediately disappears
- Coming forth is tautological movement of fact to itself
- Mediation through conditions and ground is disappearing of both
- Coming forth into concrete existence so immediate, mediated only by disappearing of mediation

### Chunk 16: Fact proceeds from ground — concrete existence
**Lines**: 491-527
**Title**: Fact proceeds from ground — concrete existence
**Key Points**:
- Fact proceeds from ground
- Not grounded or posited by it in manner ground stays underneath as substrate
- Positing is outward movement of ground to itself and simple disappearing of it
- Through union with conditions, obtains external immediacy and moment of being
- But not as something external, nor by referring externally
- As ground makes itself into positedness
- Simple essentiality rejoins itself in positedness
- In sublating itself, disappearing of difference from positedness
- Simple essential immediacy
- Does not linger as distinct from grounded
- Truth of grounding is in grounding ground unites with itself
- Reflection into another is reflection into itself
- Fact is unconditioned and, as such, groundless
- Arises from ground only in so far as latter foundered and no longer ground
- Rises up from groundless, from own essential negativity or pure form
- Immediacy, mediated by ground and condition and self-identical through sublating of mediation
- Is concrete existence
