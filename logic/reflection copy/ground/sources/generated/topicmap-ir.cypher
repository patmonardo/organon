Presupposed unconditioned is groundless immediate whose being is to be there, without grounds. If all conditions at hand, scattered manifold internally recollects itself. Whole fact must be there within conditions. All conditions belong to concrete existence. Recollecting is foundering to ground and coming to be of ground. Ground is posited ground, to extent ground, to that extent sublated as ground, is immediate being. If all conditions at hand, sublate themselves, ground equally sublated. Latter proves only reflective shine that immediately disappears. Coming forth is tautological movement of fact to itself. Mediation through conditions and ground is disappearing of both.
