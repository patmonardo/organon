**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage

- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `be-b-intro` | Indifference posited as existing for itself | 3-5 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-1-1` | Substrate as one indivisible independent measure | 7-22 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-1-2` | Inverse ratio — qualitative determination | 24-52 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-1-3` | Two qualities — each side contains both | 54-68 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-1-4` | Inverted relation recurs — continuation into each other | 70-85 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-2-1` | Indifference as existence — totality | 87-108 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-2-a` | Determinacies emerge groundlessly — external | 110-128 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-2-b` | Inverse quantitative relation — externally determined | 130-144 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-2-c` | Quantitative determinateness as subsistence — contradiction | 146-169 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-3-1` | Qualitative connection — equilibrium | 171-195 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `be-b-3-2` | Contradiction — essence | 197-229 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Section structure (1, 2, 3) and subsections (a, b, c) properly respected

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Follows Hegel's structural divisions (Introduction, Section 1, Section 2 with subsections, Section 3)
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in essence (transition to next sphere)

### Key Concepts
- **Indifference posited as existing for itself**: Determination posited in indifference itself
- **Substrate**: One indivisible independent measure, continuing into one another
- **Inverse ratio**: Qualitative determination, fixed measure as absolute limit, real substrate
- **Two qualities**: Each side contains both, distinguished by more/less, inseparable unity
- **Inverted relation recurs**: Continuation into each other, self-sameness of qualities, self-subsistent
- **Indifference as existence**: Totality of posited realization, developed determinateness
- **Determinacies emerge groundlessly**: External, immediate, not self-determining
- **Inverse quantitative relation**: Externally determined, defects of quantitative form
- **Quantitative determinateness as subsistence**: Contradiction, immediate opposition
- **Qualitative connection**: Equilibrium, inseparable unity, meaning/reality only in connection
- **Contradiction — essence**: Self-sublating contradiction, unity immanently negative and absolute = essence

### Structural Analysis
- **Introduction**: Sets up the problem (indifference posited as existing for itself)
- **Section 1**: Development of substrate and inverse ratio (4 chunks)
- **Section 2**: Examination of indifference as existence with three defects (a, b, c) (4 chunks)
- **Section 3**: Contradiction and transition to essence (2 chunks)

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Structure properly respects Hegel's divisions
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (transition-essence.txt)
