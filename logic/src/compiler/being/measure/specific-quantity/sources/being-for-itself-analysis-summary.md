# Source Analysis Summary: being-for-itself.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 192
- **Chunks Extracted**: 4
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `sq-c-1` | Qualities immediate vs specified — space and time example | 3-30 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-c-2` | Immediacy and direct ratio — moment of belonging to measure | 32-50 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-c-3` | Empirical coefficient — being-for-itself as immediate quantum | 52-141 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-c-4` | Unity of immediate and specified measures — real being-for-itself | 143-190 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Numbered sections (1., 2., 3.) properly aligned

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in real being-for-itself (transition to next section)

### Key Concepts
- **Qualities immediate vs specified**: Space and time subsisting independently outside specification
- **Immediacy and direct ratio**: Moment of belonging to measure, empirical determination
- **Empirical coefficient**: Being-for-itself as immediate quantum, motion of falling bodies (s = at^2)
- **Unity of measures**: Real being-for-itself, twofold existence, repulsion into distinct somethings
- **Mathematical example**: s = at^2 illustrating empirical coefficient and being-for-itself
- **Gravity**: Force of nature, ratio determined by nature of time and space
- **Direct ratio**: Reflectively formal velocity, no concrete existence
- **Negative unity**: Real being-for-itself, complete self-subsistence

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → This completes the Specific Quantity chapter analysis
