## Overview

Repulsion and Attraction are the two essential moments of being-for-itself. Repulsion is the fragmentation of one into many, the negative relating that presupposes ones as existent. Attraction is the ideality realized, the positing of one distinct from other ones. They are essentially joined together, each presupposing the other. The connection of repulsion and attraction shows that each contains the other as moment. Repulsion of existent ones is self-preservation of one through mutual holding off of others. Attraction of existent ones is their ideality and positing of one. As both negating and producing of one, attraction sublates itself. As positing within it of one, is negative of itself: repulsion.

## Structure

### a. Exclusion of the one (lines 4-136)
- **Mutual repulsion and self-preservation**: Many ones are each a being. Their existence or reference to one another is non-reference, external: abstract void. They themselves are negative reference to themselves as existent others. Demonstrated contradiction, infinity posited in immediacy of being. Repulsion finds immediately before it that which is repelled. Repulsion is excluding: one repels many not generated by it. Repelling is mutual or from all sides, relative, limited by being of ones. Plurality not at first posited otherness. Limit is void, that in which ones are not, but in limit they also are. Mutual repulsion is posited existence of many ones. Not their being-for-itself, but their own distinguishing which preserves them. They mutually negate themselves, posit one another as being only for-one. They negate this being only for-one, repel ideality they have and are. Moments which in ideality absolutely united come apart. In plurality distinguished one has being. Being-for-one determined in exclusion is being-for-other. Each repelled by other, sublated, made into one not for itself but for-one. Being-for-itself of many ones shows itself as self-preservation. Through mediation of mutual repulsion in which they sublate themselves reciprocally. Self-preservation consists in repelling ideality, positing ones as not being for-an-other. **Self-preservation through negative reference is rather their dissolution**.
- **Ones maintaining themselves through reciprocal exclusion**: Ones not only are but maintain themselves through reciprocal exclusion. In their being-in-itself as contrasted with reference to other. Should have firm point of support for diversity as against being negated. In-itselfness rests on their being ones, but they all are this. In being-in-itself, instead of diversity, they are all same. Their existence and way of relating is reciprocal negating. This is one and same determination of all, positing themselves as identical. By being in themselves same, ideality is their own, they repel just as little. According to being and positing, only one affirmative unity. Comparison: from either side show themselves as one and same, indistinguishable. They are and are only inasmuch as they negate themselves reciprocally. Keep away ideality, their being negated, negate reciprocal negating. They are only inasmuch as they negate. Since reciprocal negating is negated, their being is negated. Negating rebounds off them, coming only by striking surface. They turn back upon themselves only by negating others. They are only as mediation, turning back is self-preservation and being-for-itself. Since negating ineffectual because of resistance, they do not return, are not. Ones themselves are each one like any other. Repulsion is referring: one excluding ones refers itself to them, to itself. Negative relating is only coming-together-with-oneself. Identity in which repelling crosses over is sublation of diversity and externality. **Self-positing-in-a-one of many ones is attraction**.

### b. The one one of attraction (lines 139-211)
**Ideality realized**: Repulsion is fragmentation of one into many. Negative relating, since they presuppose each other as existent. Only ought of ideality; **ideality realized in attraction**. Repulsion passes over into attraction, many ones into one one. Both distinguished: repulsion as reality, attraction as posited ideality. Attraction refers to repulsion by having it for presupposition. Repulsion delivers material for attraction. If no ones, nothing to attract. Representation of continuing attraction presupposes continuing generation. Sense representation of spatial attraction gives continuity. To replace atoms vanishing, another multitude comes from void. If attraction accomplished, result inert one, no longer attraction. Ideality in attraction has determination of negation of itself, many ones. Attraction inseparable from repulsion. To attract pertains to each of many ones equally. None has advantage, equilibrium in attraction and repulsion. Inert state of rest without ideality. No immediately present one taking precedence. Attraction is positing of given lack of distinction among ones. Attraction is positing of one distinct from other ones. Through posited negation, one of attraction proceeds. Determined as mediated one, one posited as one. First ones as immediate do not return into themselves in ideality. Have ideality each in another. **One one is ideality realized, posited in one**. Attracts through mediation of repulsion. Contains mediation as determination. Does not swallow attracted ones abstractly. Contains repulsion, preserves ones as many within it. By attracting, musters something, gains area or filling. Unity of repulsion and attraction in general.

### c. The connection of repulsion and attraction (lines 213-393)
- **Inseparable unity**: Difference of one and many determined as difference of mutual reference. Breaks down into two: repulsion and attraction. Each stands at first outside other on its own. Two essentially joined together nevertheless. Still indeterminate unity must be brought out in greater detail. Repulsion appears first as fundamental determination of one. Appears as immediate, like ones generated by it. Indifferent to attraction added externally as presupposed. Attraction not presupposed by repulsion. Not supposed to have part in positing and being of repulsion. As if repulsion not already negation of itself. Ones not already negated in it. Repulsion in abstraction, by itself. Attraction holds out to ones immediate existence as other. Mere repulsion is dispersion of many ones in indeterminacy. Outside sphere of repulsion itself. Repulsion is negating of connection of many to one another. Lack of connection is determination when abstractly taken. Repulsion not just void. Ones, although unconnected, do not repel what constitutes determination. Although negative, repulsion essentially connection. Mutual repulsion and flight not liberation. Excluded still stands in connection with what excluded from it. **Moment of connection is attraction, within repulsion itself**. Negating of abstract repulsion by which ones would each be existent. Referring only to itself without mutual exclusion. Starting with repulsion as immediately present. Attraction posited as intruding externally. Two held apart as diverse determinations despite inseparability. Not just repulsion presupposed by attraction. Reverse connection: repulsion has attraction for presupposition. As determined, inseparable. Each determined as ought and limitation with respect to other. Ought is abstract determinateness as existent in itself. Directed beyond itself, refers to other. Through mediation of other, each is as other. Self-subsistence consists in being mutually posited in mediation. Repulsion is positing of many; attraction positing of one. Attraction negation of many; repulsion negation of ideality of many in one. Attraction only through mediation of repulsion. Repulsion only through mediation of attraction. Mediation of each with itself through other is negated. Each is its own self-mediation. Closer examination brings back to unity of concept.
- **Self-presupposing**: Each presupposes itself, refers only to itself. Present in way relative repulsion and attraction behave at first. Relative repulsion is mutual repulsion of many ones already at hand. That there be many ones is repulsion itself. Presupposition only its own positing. Determination of being accruing to ones apart from positing belongs to repulsion. Repelling is that through which ones manifest and maintain themselves. Through which they are as such. Their being is their repulsion itself. Not relative existence against another other. Relates itself throughout only to itself. Attraction is positing of one as such, real one. With respect to which existence of many determined as vanishing idealization. Attraction directly presupposes itself. Presupposes itself in determination of many ones to be idealization. Same ones otherwise supposed to have existence, repel others. Ideality not attained only through relation to attraction. Ideality presupposed: ideality of ones as existent in itself. As ones, not distinguished but one and same. **Self-presupposing implies each contains other as moment**. Self-presupposing is positing of oneself in one as negative of oneself (repulsion). Presupposed is same as that which presupposes (attraction). Each is in itself only moment. Transition of each from itself into other. Negation of itself in other, positing of itself as other of itself. One is coming-out-of-itself. Positing of itself as its other, as many. Many is falling back upon itself. Positing of itself as its other, as one. Connecting of itself to itself, each continuing itself in its other. Coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and self-positing-as-one (attraction) inherently present as undivided. In relative repulsion and attraction, two are each negation of itself. Continuity of itself in its other. Repulsion of existent ones is self-preservation of one. Through mutual holding off of others. Other ones negated in it (attraction as ideality). One is in itself, without reference to others. In-itself passed over into being-for-itself. One in itself is coming to be of many. Attraction of existent ones is their ideality and positing of one. As both negating and producing of one, attraction sublates itself. As positing within it of one, is negative of itself: repulsion.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Mutual Repulsion**: Many ones are each a being. Their existence or reference to one another is non-reference, external: abstract void. They themselves are negative reference to themselves as existent others.

2. **Self-Preservation**: Being-for-itself of many ones shows itself as self-preservation. Through mediation of mutual repulsion in which they sublate themselves reciprocally. **Self-preservation through negative reference is rather their dissolution**.

3. **Ones Maintaining Themselves**: Ones not only are but maintain themselves through reciprocal exclusion. In their being-in-itself, instead of diversity, they are all same. They are and are only inasmuch as they negate themselves reciprocally.

4. **Attraction**: Self-positing-in-a-one of many ones is attraction. Repulsion passes over into attraction, many ones into one one.

5. **Ideality Realized**: Only ought of ideality; **ideality realized in attraction**. One one is ideality realized, posited in one. Attracts through mediation of repulsion.

6. **Inseparable Unity**: Two essentially joined together nevertheless. Moment of connection is attraction, within repulsion itself. Each determined as ought and limitation with respect to other.

7. **Self-Presupposing**: **Self-presupposing implies each contains other as moment**. Self-presupposing is positing of oneself in one as negative of oneself (repulsion). Presupposed is same as that which presupposes (attraction).

8. **Transition**: One is coming-out-of-itself. Positing of itself as its other, as many. Many is falling back upon itself. Positing of itself as its other, as one. Connecting of itself to itself, each continuing itself in its other.

9. **Sublation**: Repulsion of existent ones is self-preservation of one. Through mutual holding off of others. Other ones negated in it (attraction as ideality). Attraction of existent ones is their ideality and positing of one. As both negating and producing of one, attraction sublates itself. As positing within it of one, is negative of itself: repulsion.

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Exclusion of the One** (mutual repulsion, self-preservation)
2. **The One One of Attraction** (ideality realized)
3. **Connection of Repulsion and Attraction** (inseparable unity, self-presupposing)

- **Many Ones → Mutual Repulsion**: Negative reference to themselves as existent others
- **Mutual Repulsion → Self-Preservation**: Through mediation of mutual repulsion

- **Attraction → Ideality Realized**: One one is ideality realized
- **Ideality → Connection**: Inseparable unity, each contains other as moment
- **Connection → Self-Presupposing**: Each is in itself only moment
- **Self-Presupposing → Sublation**: Attraction sublates itself, is negative of itself: repulsion

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: exclusion → attraction → connection
- The key insight is that **repulsion and attraction are inseparable, each contains the other as moment**
- Self-preservation through negative reference is rather dissolution
- Ideality is realized in attraction
- Self-presupposing implies each contains other as moment
- This completes being-for-itself and prepares the transition to quantity
