# Being Idea Workbook

Part: `IDEA. BEING`
Status: active
Authority: original source text only

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `src/compiler/being/quality/being/sources/WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for this part.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact heading order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Clean-room rules

- Source authority is limited to Being source files in this folder.
- Claims must be line-anchored.
- If uncertain, mark `review_pending` and capture an open question.
- Span boundaries must follow complete sentence groups (no mid-sentence start/end).

## TopicMap terminology contract

- Workbook = serialized artifact of one TopicMap.
- TopicMap = graph container (topics + typed relations) within the broader Knowledge Graph.
- Entry (Topic) = one topic node with id, title, key points, claims, and relations.
- Scope / section / span = textual referents for source inclusion boundaries.
- Chunk = informal analysis term only; do not use as a formal schema field.

## Working template

### Entry (Topic) `id` — `title`

- span: `lineStart-lineEnd`
- summary: one sentence
- keyPoints: (KeyPoint) 3-8 non-redundant points
- claims: (Claim) 1-3 minimum, with evidence
- relations: (Relation) typed only (`supports|contrasts|negates|sublates|presupposes|refines|transitions_to`), using labeled bullets (`r1`, `r2`, ...)

## Session: 2026-02-22 (initial scaffold)

Scope:

- files:
  - `being.txt`
  - `nothing.txt`
  - `becoming.txt`
- focus: sphere-level map across Part A/B/C and handoff toward Existence

Decision:

- Keep this workbook as the Being-IDEA coordinator.
- Keep `BEING-PART-A/B/C-WORKBOOK.md` as first-order extraction artifacts.
- Defer higher-order synthesis claims until part-level spans are stabilized.

Review outcome:

- review_pending
- notes: initialized; ready for sphere-level coordinator entry.
