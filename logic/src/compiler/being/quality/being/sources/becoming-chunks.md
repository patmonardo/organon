# Chunking Plan for becoming.txt - C. BECOMING

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Chunk the text into readable semantic units that preserve the movement of the source.
The TopicMap is a check that each unit is text-grounded and trackable.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining chunks through review.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**

- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: C. BECOMING (108 lines)

- 1. Unity of being and nothing (lines 11-30)
- 2. The moments of becoming (lines 32-82)
  - Becoming as unseparatedness (lines 33-44)
  - Two unities: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be (lines 46-60)
  - Interpenetration and self-sublation (lines 62-82)
- 3. Sublation of becoming (lines 84-108)
  - Equilibrium and quiescent unity (lines 85-91)
  - Contradiction and vanishedness (lines 93-99)
  - Transition to existence (lines 101-108)

**Note**: Focusing on the Species (C. BECOMING) only, ignoring top-level Genus introduction.
This section tracks the movement of being and nothing into and out of each other.

**Workflow**:

```
Source Text → [Source Analysis] → Chunks + Topics → [Logical Op Generation] → Logical Operations
```

**Chunk Quality Check**:

- At a glance, the chunk should show a complete move in the text
- Meaning should be visible without reading every word
- If a line break blocks that, adjust boundaries

**TopicMap**: See `becoming-topic-map.ts` for the formal TopicMap structure that maps to:

- `TopicMapEntry.id` → `Chunk.id`
- `TopicMapEntry.title` → `Chunk.title` AND `LogicalOperation.label` (the "Title")
- `TopicMapEntry.lineRange` → Extract text → `Chunk.text`

The TopicMap keeps chunk IDs, titles, and line ranges aligned with the source text.

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: C.1. Unity of being and nothing — same yet distinct

**Lines**: 11-30
**Title**: C.1. Unity of being and nothing — same yet distinct
**Key Points**:

- Pure being and pure nothing are the same
- Truth is neither being nor nothing
- Being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being
- "Has passed over," not passes over
- They are not without distinction
- They are not the same, absolutely distinct
- Yet equally unseparated and inseparable
- Each immediately vanishes in its opposite
- Truth is movement of immediate vanishing of one into the other
- Becoming: movement in which two are distinguished
- Distinction has just as immediately dissolved itself

### Chunk 2: C.2. Becoming as unseparatedness — determinate unity

**Lines**: 33-44
**Title**: C.2. Becoming as unseparatedness — determinate unity
**Key Points**:

- Becoming is unseparatedness of being and nothing
- Not unity that abstracts from being and nothing
- Unity of being and nothing is determinate unity
- One in which being and nothing equally are
- Each unseparated from its other, each is not
- In unity they are, but as vanishing, only as sublated
- Sink from self-subsistence into moments still distinguished but sublated

### Chunk 3: C.2. Two unities — being and nothing as moments

**Lines**: 46-60
**Title**: C.2. Two unities — being and nothing as moments
**Key Points**:

- Each in distinguishedness is unity with the other
- Becoming contains being and nothing as two unities
- Each unity is itself unity of being and nothing
- One: being as immediate and reference to nothing
- Other: nothing as immediate and reference to being
- Determinations of unequal value
- Becoming doubly determined: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be

### Chunk 4: C.2. Coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be — interpenetration

**Lines**: 62-82
**Title**: C.2. Coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be — interpenetration
**Key Points**:

- Both are the same, becoming
- Directions interpenetrate and paralyze each other
- One is ceasing-to-be: being passes over into nothing
- Nothing is opposite of itself: passing-over into being, coming-to-be
- Coming-to-be is other direction: nothing goes over into being
- Being equally sublates itself: passing-over into nothing, ceasing-to-be
- They do not sublate themselves reciprocally
- Each rather sublates itself in itself
- Each is within it the opposite of itself

### Chunk 5: C.3. Equilibrium and quiescent unity — vanishing of becoming

**Lines**: 85-91
**Title**: C.3. Equilibrium and quiescent unity — vanishing of becoming
**Key Points**:

- Equilibrium of coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be is becoming itself
- Becoming collects itself in quiescent unity
- Being and nothing are in it only as vanishing
- Becoming only by virtue of their being distinguished
- Vanishing is vanishing of becoming, vanishing of vanishing itself
- Becoming is ceaseless unrest that collapses into quiescent result

### Chunk 6: C.3. Contradiction and vanishedness — not nothing

**Lines**: 93-99
**Title**: C.3. Contradiction and vanishedness — not nothing
**Key Points**:

- Becoming is vanishing of being into nothing, nothing into being
- Vanishing of being and nothing in general
- Rests on their being distinct
- Contradicts itself in itself
- Union destroys itself
- Result is vanishedness, but not nothing
- Would be relapse into already sublated determinations
- Not result of nothing and of being

### Chunk 7: C.3. Transition to existence — quiescent simplicity

**Lines**: 101-108
**Title**: C.3. Transition to existence — quiescent simplicity
**Key Points**:

- Unity of being and nothing that has become quiescent simplicity
- Quiescent simplicity is being
- No longer for itself but as determination of whole
- Becoming as transition into unity of being and nothing
- Unity which is as existent
- Has shape of one-sided immediate unity of these moments
- Is existence
