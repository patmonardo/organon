# Chunking Plan for being.txt - A. BEING

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Chunk the text into readable semantic units that preserve the movement of the source.
The TopicMap is a check that each unit is text-grounded and trackable.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining chunks through review.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**

- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: A. BEING (18 lines)

- Pure being without determination (lines 32-39)
- Pure being as emptiness and nothing (lines 40-47)

**Note**: Focusing on the Species (A. BEING) only, ignoring top-level Genus introduction.

**Workflow**:

```
Source Text → [Source Analysis] → Chunks + Topics → [Logical Op Generation] → Logical Operations
```

**Chunk Quality Check**:

- At a glance, the chunk should show a complete move in the text
- Meaning should be visible without reading every word
- If a line break blocks that, adjust boundaries

**TopicMap**: See `being-topic-map.ts` for the formal TopicMap structure that maps to:

- `TopicMapEntry.id` → `Chunk.id`
- `TopicMapEntry.title` → `Chunk.title` AND `LogicalOperation.label` (the "Title")
- `TopicMapEntry.lineRange` → Extract text → `Chunk.text`

The TopicMap keeps chunk IDs, titles, and line ranges aligned with the source text.

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Pure being without determination

**Lines**: 32-39
**Title**: Pure being without determination
**Key Points**:

- Being, pure being, without further determination
- In indeterminate immediacy equal only to itself
- Not unequal with respect to another
- No difference within it, nor any outwardly
- If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, it would fail to hold fast to its purity
- Pure indeterminateness and emptiness (as developed across the section)

### Chunk 2: Pure being as emptiness — nothing to intuit or think

**Lines**: 40-47
**Title**: Pure being as emptiness — nothing to intuit or think
**Key Points**:

- Pure indeterminateness and emptiness
- Nothing to be intuited in it
- Only pure empty intuiting itself
- Nothing to be thought in it
- Equally only empty thinking
- Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing
- Neither more nor less than nothing
