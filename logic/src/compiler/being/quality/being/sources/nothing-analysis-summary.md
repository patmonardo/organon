## Overview

Pure Nothing is simple equality with itself: complete emptiness and absence of determination. In intuiting and thinking, nothing is distinguished from something, and this shows its meaning. The section closes by stating that nothing is the same determination (absence of determination) as pure being.

## Structure

### Pure nothingness as simple equality (lines 12-16)

**Complete emptiness**: Nothing, pure nothingness. It is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content, lack of all distinction within.

### Nothing in intuiting and thinking (lines 17-28)

**Same as pure being**: In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or nothing is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being. **Nothing is therefore the same determination or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as what pure being is**.

## Main Points from the Text

1. **Simple Equality**: Nothing is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness.

2. **Complete Absence**: Complete absence of determination and content, lack of all distinction within.

3. **Difference in Intuiting/Thinking**: It makes a difference whether something or nothing is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning.

4. **Nothing Is (Concretely Exists)**: The two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking.

5. **Empty Intuiting and Thinking**: Nothing is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being.

6. **Identity with Being**: **Nothing is therefore the same determination or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as what pure being is**.

## Movement in the Text

1. **Pure Nothing** (simple equality, complete emptiness)
2. **Nothing in Intuiting/Thinking** (concretely exists)
3. **Identity with Being** (same determination, transition to C. BECOMING)

## Transitions

- **Nothing → Emptiness**: Simple equality with itself, complete emptiness
- **Emptiness → Identity with Being**: Nothing is the same as pure being
- **Nothing → Becoming**: The identity of Being and Nothing prepares the transition to Becoming

## Terms in Play

- **Pure Nothing**: Simple equality with itself, complete emptiness
- **Complete Absence**: Absence of determination and content
- **Empty Intuiting/Thinking**: Like pure being, empty intuiting and thinking itself
- **Being**: The same as nothing
- **Becoming**: The movement of passing-over between being and nothing (C. BECOMING)

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: pure nothing → emptiness → identity with being
- The key line is: **Nothing is therefore the same determination or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as what pure being is**
- This identity prepares the transition to Becoming, where Being and Nothing vanish into each other
- Chunk quality check: each chunk should be readable at a glance, with meaning flashing without reading every word
