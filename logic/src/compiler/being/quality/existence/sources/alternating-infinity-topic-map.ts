 * TopicMap for alternating-infinity.txt - C. INFINITY (b) Alternating determination of finite and infinite
 *
 * This TopicMap follows C. INFINITY (b) Alternating determination of finite and infinite in the source text.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - Introduction: Infinite falls back into category of something; finite resurrected
 * - Further determination: finite and infinite as others; bad infinite
 * - Contradiction: two determinacies, two worlds; develops into explicit forms
 * - Unity appears as transition; process of transition
 * - Alternating determination; progress to infinity
 * - Abstract transcending incomplete; unity not reflected upon
