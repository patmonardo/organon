## Overview

This is the second subspecies of B. FINITUDE, developing **determination** and **constitution** as moments that pass over into each other, leading to the emergence of **limit** as the immanent determination that makes something finite. The analysis moves from the mediated in-itself through determination and constitution to limit as the contradiction that propels something beyond itself.

## Structure

### Introduction (lines 4-25)
The in-itself is no longer abstract but mediated through being-for-other. Being-for-other is its moment. Determinateness existent-in-itself—development consists in positing such determinateness as immanently reflected.

### 1. Determination (lines 27-78)
- **Definition**: Affirmative determinateness; the in-itself by which something abides in existence while involved with other; preserves itself in self-equality.
- **Example**: Human being's determination is rational thought (vocation). Thinking in himself (distinguished from being-for-other) but also in him (concrete existence). Still only in itself as ought.

### 2. Constitution (lines 80-161)
- **External existence**: Filling distinct from determinateness only being-for-other. What something has in it separates itself as external existence, not belonging to being-in-itself. Determinateness = constitution.
- **External influences**: Something caught up in external influences, relationships. Quality of something to be given over to externality.
- **Alteration**: Falls on constitution, not determination. Something preserves itself; alteration affects only unstable surface.
- **Pass over into each other**: Determination and constitution distinct but connected. What something has in it = middle term. Determination passes over into constitution; constitution into determination.
- **Alteration posited**: No longer only implicit (inner concept); now posited in something. Negation immanent as developed being-in-itself.

### Transition (lines 163-227)
- **Sublation → two somethings**: Transition of determination and constitution = sublation of distinction. Since distinction includes qualitative otherness: two somethings. Negation now immanent.
- **Limit emerges**: Something behaves to other through itself. Otherness posited in it as own moment. In-itselfness holds negation. Negation of other = quality of something. This determinateness = limit.

### 3. Limit (lines 229-410)

#### (a) Non-being of other and of something; mediation (lines 245-285)
- Limit = non-being of other, not of something itself. But other is itself something, so limit = non-being of something in general.
- Through limit, something at same time is. Limit = being of something; something has quality in it.
- Limit = simple negation (first negation); other = negation of negation (in-itselfness).
- Limit = mediation in virtue of which something and other each both is and is not.

#### (b) Existence outside/inside limit; limit as middle point (lines 287-312)
- Something in limit both is and is not. Non-existence and existence fall outside each other.
- Something has existence outside limit (or inside, as representation). Limit = middle point at which they leave off.
- Line outside point, plane outside line, solid outside plane (figurative representation).

#### (c) Something outside limit = existence in general; limit as principle; unrest/contradiction (lines 314-405)
- Something outside limit = unlimited something = only existence in general. Not distinguished from other; both same.
- Immediate existence now posited in them as limit. In limit both distinct. Limit = common distinguishedness, unity and distinguishedness.
- Something has existence only in limit. Limit and immediate existence negative of each other. Something only in limit separates from itself, points beyond, passes over.
- Limit as principle: Point = limit of line (not because line ceases, but point is beginning). Point = absolute beginning, element. Limits = principle of that which they delimit.
- Unrest/contradiction: Unrest of something in limit (immanent). Contradiction propels it beyond itself. Point = dialectic becoming line; line becoming plane; plane becoming total space.
- Point, line, plane per se self-contradictory beginnings. Repel themselves from themselves. Pass over through concept. There is no point, just as no line or plane.

### Conclusion (lines 407-410)
Something posited with immanent limit as contradiction of itself, by virtue of which directed and driven out and beyond itself = **the finite**.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **In-Itself Mediated**: No longer abstract but mediated through being-for-other. Being-for-other is its moment.

2. **Determination**: Affirmative determinateness; in-itself by which something abides. What something is in itself also present in it. Still only in itself as ought.

3. **Constitution**: External existence, not belonging to being-in-itself. Something caught up in external influences. Alteration falls on constitution, not determination.

4. **Pass Over into Each Other**: Determination and constitution distinct but connected. What something has in it = middle term. They pass over into each other.

5. **Limit as Mediation**: Non-being of other and of something. Through limit, something is. Limit = mediation in virtue of which something and other each both is and is not.

6. **Limit as Principle**: Point = limit of line (beginning, element). Limits = principle of that which they delimit.

7. **Limit as Contradiction**: Unrest of something in limit (immanent). Contradiction propels it beyond itself. Point, line, plane self-contradictory beginnings.

8. **Finite**: Something with immanent limit as contradiction of itself, directed and driven beyond itself.

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Determination** (in-itself, affirmative)
2. **Constitution** (external existence, alteration)
3. **Limit** (immanent, contradiction, propels beyond)

## Transition Points

- **In-Itself → Determination**: Mediated through being-for-other; determinateness existent-in-itself
- **Determination → Constitution**: What something has in it separates; passes over into each other
- **Constitution → Limit**: Sublation → two somethings; negation immanent; limit emerges
- **Limit → Finite**: Immanent limit as contradiction propels beyond itself

## Related Concepts

- **Being-for-Other**: The moment through which in-itself is mediated
- **Something and Other**: The two somethings that emerge from sublation
- **Quality**: What something has in it; limit as quality
- **Finitude**: The result—something with immanent limit as contradiction

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: determination → constitution → limit → finite
- The geometric examples (point, line, plane) are important illustrations but may not become LOs directly
- The transition from determination/constitution to limit is a critical moment
