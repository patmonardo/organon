## Overview

Existence is the first moment of Qualitative Logic—the determinate being that emerges from Becoming. It completes the foundational structure: **Being → Nothing → Becoming → Existence (Quality → Something)**.

## Structure

### Outline (lines 4-13)
The section outlines the threefold development: determinateness → quality (reality|negation) → something (existent).

### a. Existence in general (lines 15-100)
- **From Becoming**: Existence proceeds from becoming as simple oneness of being and nothing, appearing as immediate (mediation behind it).
- **Da-sein**: Not mere being but Dasein—being with non-being, where non-being is taken up into simple unity. This constitutes determinateness as such.
- **Reflection vs Posited**: Critical methodological distinction—being as moment (for us, by reflection) vs determinateness-posited (in it). Only posited belongs to concept's content.
- **Correspondence**: Being is indeterminate; existence is determinate being, concrete, where multiple determinations emerge.

### b. Quality (lines 102-155)
- **Immediate Unity**: Being and nothing are one in existence; to the extent existent, to that extent non-being. No posited differentiation yet.
- **Definition**: Quality = existent determinateness (simple, immediate). Determinateness can further determine as quantity.
- **Reality and Negation**: Existence measures one-sidedness of quality. Quality posited as nothing → reflection. Reality = quality accented as existent; Negation = quality under negating (lack, limit, restriction).
- **Valuation**: Both are existence. Reality conceals its negation (appears as pure positive). Negation is existence determined with non-being.

### c. Something (lines 157-267)
- **Unity of Reality and Negation**: Both present and sublated in existence. Quality unseparated from existence.
- **Sublation Yields Being-in-Itself**: Sublation (not omission) → simplicity mediated → being-in-itself = something.
- **Negation of Negation**: Something = first negation of negation, beginning of subject (still indeterminate). Distinguish abstract negation from concrete negation-of-negation.
- **Mediation-with-Itself**: Posited in something (against "bare immediacy"). Mediation pervades all concepts.
- **Becoming with Other**: Something's becoming has moments as existents: itself and its negative (the other).
- **Alteration**: Initially only conceptual; negative posited as qualitative "other in general."

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Existence Completes Qualitative Logic**: The first moment of Qualitative Logic, determinate being emerging from Becoming.

2. **Da-sein Structure**: Being with non-being, where non-being is taken up into unity—the foundation of determinateness.

3. **Reflection Discipline**: Critical distinction between what is posited in the concept vs what belongs to external reflection. Only posited belongs to content.

4. **Quality as Existent Determinateness**: Simple, immediate determinateness that can further determine as quantity.

5. **Reality vs Negation**: Both are existence; reality conceals its negation, negation is existence with non-being.

6. **Something as Beginning of Subject**: First negation of negation, still superficial but the foundation for further development (for-itself → concept).

7. **Mediation Pervasive**: Against doctrines of "bare immediacy"—mediation is found everywhere, in every concept.

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Existence** (immediate, from becoming)
2. **Quality** (determinateness distinguished: reality|negation)
3. **Something** (negation of negation, being-in-itself, beginning of subject)

## Transition Points

- **Becoming → Existence**: Mediation sublated, appears as immediate first
- **Existence → Quality**: Determinateness distinguished as existent determinateness
- **Quality → Something**: Reality and negation sublated, existence reflects into itself as being-in-itself

## Related Concepts

- **Becoming**: The mediation that lies behind existence
- **Being/Nothing**: The moments unified in existence
- **Reality/Negation**: The two determinations of quality
- **Other**: The negative moment of something (to be developed in Finitude)

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows the dialectical progression: immediate → distinction → sublation
- Methodological chunks (reflection vs posited) are important for understanding but may not become LOs directly
