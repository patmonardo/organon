 * This TopicMap follows B. FINITUDE (c) Finitude in the source text.

 * Structure:
 * - Introduction: Definition of finitude; non-being as nature; perishing; hour of birth = hour of death
 * - (a) The immediacy of finitude:
 *   - Mournful note; qualitative negation driven to extreme; understanding's persistence
 *   - Finite as absolute? No—depends on view; contradiction with infinite
 * - (b) Restriction and the ought:
 *   - Contradiction abstractly present; limit as finitude
 *   - Determination and constitution; limit as connection; restriction and ought
 *   - Ought: double determination; finite = ought + restriction; ought transcends restriction
 * - (c) Transition of the finite into the infinite:
 *   - Ought and restriction mutually connected; finite as contradiction
 *   - Result (a): other finite (infinite progression)
 *   - Result (b): identity with itself = infinite

    description:
      "This is a very important consideration. But that the finite is absolute is certainly not a standpoint that any philosophy or outlook, or the understanding, would want to endorse. The opposite is rather expressly present in the assertion of finitude: the finite is the restricted, the perishable, the finite is only the finite, not the imperishable; all this is immediately part and parcel of its determination and expression. But all depends on whether in one's view of finitude its being is insisted on, and the transitoriness thus persists, or whether the transitoriness and the perishing perish. The fact is that this perishing of the perishing does not happen on precisely the view that would make the perishing the final end of the finite.",

    description:
      "Determination and constitution arose as sides for external reflection, but determination already contained otherness as belonging to the in-itself of something. On the one side, the externality of otherness is within the something's own inwardness; on the other side, it remains as otherness distinguished from it; it is still externality as such, but in the something. But further, since otherness is determined as limit, itself as negation of the negation, the otherness immanent to the something is posited as the connection of the two sides, and the unity of the something with itself (to which both determination and constitution belong) is its reference turned back upon itself, the reference to it of its implicitly existing determination that in it negates its immanent limit. The self-identical in-itself thus refers itself to itself as to its own non-being, but as negation of the negation, as negating that which at the same time retains existence in it, for it is the quality of its in-itselfness. Something's own limit, thus posited by it as a negative which is at the same time essential, is not only limit as such, but restriction. But restriction is not alone in being posited as negative; the negation cuts two ways, for that which it posits as negated is limit, and limit is in general what is common to something and other, and is also the determinateness of the in-itself of determination as such. This in-itself, consequently, as negative reference to its limit (which is also distinguished from it), as negative reference to itself as restriction, is the ought.",

The being-in-itself of the something is thus reduced in its determination to the ought because the very thing that constitutes the something's in-itselfness is, in one and the same respect, as non-being; or again, because in the in-itselfness, in the negation of the negation, the said being-in-itself is as one negation (what negates) a unity with the other, and this other, as qualitatively other, is the limit by virtue of which that unity is as reference to it.
