C. THE LIMITING OF QUANTITY

Discrete magnitude has,
first, the one for its principle
and, second, is a plurality of ones;
third, it is essentially continuous,
it is the one as at the same time
sublated, as unity,
the self-continuing as such
in the discreteness of the ones.
Consequently, it is posited as one magnitude,
and the "one" is its determinateness;
a "one" which, in this posited and determinate existence,
excludes, is a limit to the unity.
Discrete magnitude as such is not supposed
to be immediately limited,
but, when distinguished from continuous magnitude,
it is an existence and a something,
the determinateness of which,
and in it also the first negation and limit,
is the "one."

This limit, besides referring to the unity
and being the moment of negation in it,
is also, as one, self-referred;
thus it is enclosing, encompassing limit.
The limit here is not at first distinct
from the something of its existence,
but, as one, is essentially this negative point itself.
But the being which is here limited is essentially as continuity,
and in virtue of this continuity it transcends the limit,
transcends this one, and is indifferent to it.
Real, discrete quantity is thus one quantity, or quantum:
quantity as an existence and a something.

Since the one which is a limit encompasses
within it the many ones of discrete quantity,
it posits them equally as sublated in it;
it is a limit to continuity simply as such
and, consequently, the distinction between
continuous and discrete magnitude is here indifferent;
or, more precisely, it is a limit to
the continuity of the one
just as much as of the other;
in this, both pass over into being quanta.
