# Source Analysis Summary: pure-quantity.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 67
- **Chunks Extracted**: 4
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `quantity-pure-intro` | Pure Quantity: sublated being-for-itself, attraction | 3-14 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantity-pure-continuity` | Continuity: simple self-same reference, unity of ones | 16-30 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantity-pure-discreteness` | Discreteness: repulsion as moment in quantity | 32-40 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantity-pure-unity` | Quantity as unity of continuity and discreteness | 42-65 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in unity of continuity and discreteness

### Key Concepts
- **Pure Quantity**: Sublated being-for-itself, repelling one becomes identical to itself, passes into attraction, obduracy melts into unity, attraction is continuity
- **Continuity**: Simple self-same reference unbroken by limit/exclusion, unity of ones (not immediate unity), contains outsideness-of-one-another without distinctions, many are equal, self-continuation
- **Discreteness**: Magnitude possesses discreteness (repulsion) as moment, repulsion expands self-equality to continuity, discreteness of confluents (ones without void), steady advance
- **Unity**: Unity of continuity and discreteness, at first continuity (being-for-itself collapsed to self-equal immediacy), contains moments as being-for-itself in truth, repulsion is creative flowing away, sameness yields continuity, coming-out-of-itself yields plurality in equality

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (continuous-discrete-magnitude.txt)
