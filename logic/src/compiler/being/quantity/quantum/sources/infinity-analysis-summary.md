### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Section structure (a, b, c) properly respected

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Follows Hegel's structural divisions (a. Its concept, b. The quantitative infinite process, c. The infinity of quantum)
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in transition to ratio (quantitative relation)

### Key Concepts
- **Quantum as self-contradictory**: Alters to another quantum, goes to infinity, ought (being-determined-for-itself is being determined in other)
- **Finitude/infinity**: Each has double meaning, each possesses moment of other
- **Qualitative vs quantitative infinite**: Quantitative finite refers to itself in infinite, mutual reference displayed in infinite process
- **Infinite process**: Expression of contradiction, reciprocal determination, quantitative infinite has quantum in it
- **Bad infinity**: Perpetual generation without attainment, beyond becomes quantum which flees to beyond
- **Infinitely great/small**: Unsubstantial shadows, contradiction (quantum ought to be great and non-finite)
- **Bad quantitative infinity**: Perpetual movement back and forth, repetition (positing, sublating), impotence of negative
- **Concept posited**: Through externality quantum is itself, concept of quantum posited in infinite progress
- **Restoration**: Negation of negation, unity of two negations, restoration of concept of magnitude, bad infinite disappears
- **Return to quality**: Quantum returns to quality, qualitatively determined, being-for-itself, infinity is in it
- **Transition to ratio**: Infinite is quality, quantum repelled from itself (two quanta as moments of unity), quantitative relation/ratio, externality turned back into itself

### Structural Analysis
- **Section a. Its concept**: Development of quantum as self-contradictory, finitude/infinity, qualitative vs quantitative (3 chunks)
- **Section b. The quantitative infinite process**: Expression of contradiction, bad infinity, infinitely great/small, bad quantitative infinity (4 chunks)
- **Section c. The infinity of quantum**: Concept posited, restoration, return to quality, transition to ratio (4 chunks)

### Philosophical Significance
- **Completion of Quantum**: This section completes the development of quantum, resolving the contradiction through negation of negation.
- **Transition to Ratio**: The transition to quantitative relation/ratio represents a major structural moment, moving from quantum to the relation of quanta.
- **Return to Quality**: Quantum returns to quality through the resolution of its contradiction, demonstrating the unity of quality and quantity.

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Structure properly respects Hegel's divisions
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → This completes the source analysis for the "Quantum" chapter

## Completion Status

**✓ COMPLETE**: All three species files in the "Quantum" chapter have been analyzed:
- ✓ `number.txt` (4 chunks)
- ✓ `quantum.txt` (8 chunks)
- ✓ `infinity.txt` (11 chunks)

**Total**: 23 chunks across the chapter, representing the complete development from number through extensive and intensive quantum to quantitative infinity and the transition to ratio.
