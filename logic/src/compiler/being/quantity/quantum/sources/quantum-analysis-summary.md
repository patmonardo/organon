# Source Analysis Summary: quantum.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 305
- **Chunks Extracted**: 8
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `quantum-extensive-magnitude` | Extensive magnitude: limit as plurality | 6-54 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-number-determinateness` | Number's determinateness: self-referring limit | 56-86 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-intensive-magnitude-degree` | Intensive magnitude: degree as simple determinateness | 88-117 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-degree-externality-quality` | Degree's externality and quality | 119-170 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-degree-contains-amount` | Degree contains amount: identity of extensive and intensive | 174-197 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-identity-two-sides` | Identity: extensive and intensive are same determinateness | 199-254 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-alteration-necessity` | Alteration of quantum: quantum must alter | 256-281 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantum-sends-beyond-infinity` | Quantum sends itself beyond itself: to infinity | 283-304 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Section structure (a, b, c) and subsections (1, 2, 3) properly respected

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Follows Hegel's structural divisions (a. Their difference, b. Identity, c. Alteration)
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in quantum sending itself beyond itself to infinity (transition to next section)

### Key Concepts
- **Extensive magnitude**: Limit as plurality, amount essentially, determinacies of quantitative limit
- **Number's determinateness**: Self-referring limit, many collapses into unity, amount as moment
- **Intensive magnitude**: Degree as simple determinateness, plurality gathered into simple determination, existence returned into being-for-itself
- **Degree's externality and quality**: Self-reference is externality to itself, amount posited outside, unitary determinateness among plurality, scale as continuous progress, quality in externality
- **Degree contains amount**: Determinateness in connection with other degrees, twentieth degree contains twenty as continuity
- **Identity**: Extensive and intensive are same determinateness, distinguished only by amount within vs without, qualitative something appears
- **Alteration**: Quantum must alter, absolute continuity with externality, limit becomes
- **Quantum sends beyond**: Infinite self-referring negation, repels itself, increases/decreases, impels itself beyond, to infinity

### Structural Analysis
- **Section a. Their difference**: Development of extensive and intensive magnitude (4 chunks)
- **Section b. Identity**: Identity of extensive and intensive magnitude (2 chunks)
- **Section c. Alteration**: Alteration of quantum leading to infinity (2 chunks)

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Structure properly respects Hegel's divisions
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (infinity.txt)
