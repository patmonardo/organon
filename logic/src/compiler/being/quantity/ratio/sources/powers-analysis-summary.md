### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `powers-being-for-itself` | Quantum as being-for-itself: unit is amount | 4-24 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `powers-exponent-qualitative` | Exponent: entirely qualitative nature | 26-38 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `powers-concept-realized` | Quantum's concept realized | 40-58 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `powers-progressive-realization` | Progressive realization: quantum's quality as ratio | 60-83 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `powers-return-quality` | Quantum returns to quality: quantity is quality | 85-115 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `powers-double-transition-measure` | Double transition and measure | 117-140 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Section structure (C. THE RATIO OF POWERS with subsections 1, 2, 3) properly respected

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Follows Hegel's structural divisions (C. THE RATIO OF POWERS with subsections 1, 2, 3)
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in transition to measure

### Key Concepts
- **Quantum as being-for-itself**: Self-identical in otherness, amount determined only by unit, unit is amount as against itself, otherness is unit itself, power is aggregate where each is aggregate itself
- **Exponent entirely qualitative**: No longer immediate quantum, amount is unit itself, quantum self-identical in otherness, truth of quality is quantity
- **Concept realized**: Ratio of powers displays what quantum is implicitly, quantum's otherness determined through quantum itself
- **Progressive realization**: Quantum's quality is difference of itself from itself (that it is a ratio), direct/inverse/powers ratios show progression
- **Return to quality**: Quantum becomes other of itself (quality), externality mediated by quantum itself, quantity is quality itself
- **Double transition and measure**: Quality ↔ quantity (double transition), quantum is quality and that by virtue of which anything is what it is, truth of quantum is measure

### Structural Analysis
- **Section 1**: Quantum as being-for-itself and exponent (2 chunks)
- **Section 2**: Concept realized and progressive realization (2 chunks)
- **Section 3**: Return to quality and double transition/measure (2 chunks)

### Philosophical Significance
- **Completion of Ratio**: The ratio of powers completes the development of ratio, showing quantum as being-for-itself where its otherness is self-determined.
- **Unity of Quality and Quantity**: The return to quality shows that quantity is quality itself, and the double transition establishes the unity of quality and quantity.
- **Transition to Measure**: The truth of quantum is to be measure - the unity of quality and quantity. This completes the Sphere of Quantity and transitions to Measure.

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Structure properly respects Hegel's divisions
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → This completes the source analysis for the "Ratio" chapter

## Completion Status

**✓ COMPLETE**: All three species files in the "Ratio" chapter have been analyzed:
- ✓ `ratio.txt` (7 chunks) - Direct Ratio
- ✓ `inverse.txt` (5 chunks) - Inverse Ratio
- ✓ `powers.txt` (6 chunks) - Ratio of Powers

**Total**: 18 chunks across the chapter, representing the complete development from direct ratio through inverse ratio to ratio of powers and the transition to measure.

**Chapter Significance**: This completes the Sphere of Quantity, showing the progressive realization of quantum's concept through the three forms of ratio, culminating in the unity of quality and quantity as measure.
