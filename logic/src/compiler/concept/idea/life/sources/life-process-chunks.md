# Chunking Plan for life-process.txt - The Life-Process

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: The Life-Process (180 lines)
- Opposition to objective world, need and pain
- Assimilation and reproduction
- Universal life as genus

**Workflow**: 
```
Source Text → [Source Analysis] → Chunks + Topics → [Logical Op Generation] → Logical Operations
```

**TopicMap**: See `life-process-topic-map.ts` for the formal TopicMap structure that maps to:
- `TopicMapEntry.id` → `Chunk.id`
- `TopicMapEntry.title` → `Chunk.title` AND `LogicalOperation.label` (the "Title")
- `TopicMapEntry.lineRange` → Extract text → `Chunk.text`

The TopicMap ensures systematic, trackable chunking that yields meaningful Logical Operations.

## Chunk 1: Opposition to Objective World - Need and Pain (lines 3-66)

**Text**: Opening through "it is even an actual, concrete existence."

**Key Points**:
- Individual sets itself in opposition to objective world
- Subject = purpose unto itself, self-subsistent
- External world = negative, without self-subsistence
- Self-feeling = certainty of nullity of otherness
- Impulse = need to sublate otherness
- Process begins with need = self-determination positing self as negated, refers to other, preserves self
- Impulse to posit world as own, sublate world, objectify self
- Self-determination = objective externality + self-identical = absolute contradiction
- Negative moment realizes = objective particularity, concept splits = absolute inequality, living being = rupture = pain
- Pain = prerogative of living natures, actuality of infinite power, contradiction as actual existence

**Keywords**: opposition, objective world, subject, purpose, need, impulse, contradiction, pain, rupture, absolute contradiction

## Chunk 2: Assimilation - Appropriation and Reproduction (lines 68-157)

**Text**: "This internal rupture" through "as self-identical for itself."

**Key Points**:
- Internal rupture taken up = feeling
- From pain = need/impulse = transition, negation becomes identity = negation of negation
- Impulse = subjective certainty, relates to external world as appearance/unessential
- Objectivity = external aptitude, mechanical determinability, impotence
- Object excites (not causes)
- Subject exercises violence, mechanism/chemism interrupted, externality transformed into interiority
- External purposiveness sublated, concept posits itself as essence
- Seizing object = internal process, appropriates, makes means, confers subjectivity
- Assimilation = reproduction, individual feeds on itself
- Life = truth of processes, power over them, permeates as universality
- Transformation = turning back into itself, production becomes reproduction, self-identical

**Keywords**: internal rupture, feeling, pain, need, impulse, assimilation, appropriation, reproduction, externality, interiority, self-identical

## Chunk 3: Universal Life as Genus (lines 159-179)

**Text**: "The immediate idea is also" through "as real universal life, as genus."

**Key Points**:
- Immediate idea = immediate identity of concept and reality (not for itself)
- Through objective process, living being gives itself feeling of self, posits itself as self-identical in otherness = negative unity of negative
- Rejoining objectivity = actual singularity, sublated particularity, raised to universality
- Particularity = disruption (individual life + external objectivity as species)
- External life-process = real universal life = genus

**Keywords**: immediate idea, objective process, feeling of self, self-identical, otherness, negative unity, actual singularity, universality, genus
