## Overview

The Beginning is the first moment of the method. What constitutes the method are the determinations of the concept itself and their connections. In this, we must begin from the beginning. Because it is the beginning, its content is an immediate, but one that has the meaning and the form of abstract universality. The immediate of sense-intuition is a manifold and a singular. Cognition, on the contrary, is a thinking that conceptualizes; its beginning, therefore, is also only in the element of thought, a simple and a universal. This first universality is an immediate universality, and for that reason it has equally the significance of being, for being is precisely this abstract self-reference. Being has no need of further derivation. The beginning, therefore, has for the method no other determinateness than that of being the simple and universal; this is precisely the determinateness that makes it deficient. Universality is the pure, simple concept, and the method, as the consciousness of this concept, is aware that universality is only a moment and that in it the concept is still not determined in and for itself. But in the absolute method the universal has the value not of a mere abstraction but of the objective universal, that is, the universal that is in itself the concrete totality, but a totality as yet not posited, not yet for itself. The beginning is made with the immediate; the immediacy of the universal is the same as what is here expressed as the in-itself that is without being-for-itself. One may well say, therefore, that every beginning must be made with the absolute, just as every advance is only the exposition of it, in so far as implicit in existence is the concept. But because the absolute exists at first only implicitly, in itself, it equally is not the absolute nor the posited concept, and also not the idea, for the in-itself is only an abstract, one-sided moment, and this is what they are. The advance is not, therefore, a kind of superfluity; this is what it would be if that which is at the beginning were already the absolute; the advance consists rather in this, that the universal determines itself and is the universal for itself, that is, equally a singular and a subject. Only in its consummation is it the absolute. A beginning which is in itself a concrete totality may as such also be free and its immediacy have the determination of an external existence; the germ of anything living, and subjective purpose in general, have shown themselves to be such beginnings; hence both are themselves impulses.

## Structure

### Beginning as simple and universal (lines 1-66)
**Abstract self-reference**: Accordingly, what constitutes the method are the determinations of the concept itself and their connections, and these we must now examine in the significance that they have as determinations of the method. In this, we must begin from the beginning. We spoke of this beginning at the very beginning of the Logic, and also in connection with subjective cognition, and we showed that, when not performed arbitrarily and in the absence of categorial sensitivity, though it may seem to present many difficulties, it is nevertheless of an extremely simple nature. Because it is the beginning, its content is an immediate, but one that has the meaning and the form of abstract universality. Or be it a content of being, or of essence or of the concept, inasmuch as it is something immediate, it is assumed, found in advance, assertoric. But first of all it is not an immediate of sense-intuition or of representation, but of thought, which because of its immediacy can also be called a supersensuous, inner intuiting. The immediate of sense-intuition is a manifold and a singular. Cognition, on the contrary, is a thinking that conceptualizes; its beginning, therefore, is also only in the element of thought, a simple and a universal. We spoke of this form earlier, in connection with definition. At the beginning of finite cognition universality is likewise recognized as an essential determination, but only as thought and concept determination in opposition to being. In fact this first universality is an immediate universality, and for that reason it has equally the significance of being, for being is precisely this abstract self-reference. Being has no need of further derivation, as if it came to the abstract element of definition only because taken from the intuition of the senses or elsewhere, and in so far as it can be pointed at. This pointing and deriving involve a mediation that is more than a mere beginning, and is a mediation of a kind that does not belong to the comprehension of thought, but is rather the elevation of representation, of empirical and ratiocinative consciousness, to the standpoint of thinking. According to the currently accepted opposition of thought, or concept, and being, it passes as a very important truth that no being belongs as yet to thought as thought, and that being has a ground of its own independent of thought. But the simple determination of being is in itself so poor that, if for that reason alone, not much fuss ought to be made about it; the universal is immediately itself this immediate because, as abstract, it is also the abstract self-reference which is being. In fact, the demand that being should be exhibited has a further, inner meaning in which more is at issue than just this abstract determination; implied in it is the demand for the realization of the concept, a realization that is missing at the beginning itself but is rather the goal and the business of the entire subsequent development of cognition.

### Beginning as deficient — Absolute as implicit (lines 68-123)
**Advance as exposition**: The beginning, therefore, has for the method no other determinateness than that of being the simple and universal; this is precisely the determinateness that makes it deficient. Universality is the pure, simple concept, and the method, as the consciousness of this concept, is aware that universality is only a moment and that in it the concept is still not determined in and for itself. But with this consciousness that would want to carry the beginning further only for the sake of method, the method is only a formal procedure posited in external reflection. Where the method, however, is the objective and immanent form, the immediate character of the beginning must be a lack inherent in the beginning itself, which must be endowed with the impulse to carry itself further. But in the absolute method the universal has the value not of a mere abstraction but of the objective universal, that is, the universal that is in itself the concrete totality, but a totality as yet not posited, not yet for itself. Even the abstract universal is as such, when considered conceptually, that is, in its truth, not just anything simple, but is, as abstract, already posited afflicted by a negation. For this reason also there is nothing so simple and so abstract, be it in actuality or in thought, as is commonly imagined. Anything as simple as that is a mere presumption that has its ground solely in the lack of awareness of what is actually there. We said earlier that the beginning is made with the immediate; the immediacy of the universal is the same as what is here expressed as the in-itself that is without being-for-itself. One may well say, therefore, that every beginning must be made with the absolute, just as every advance is only the exposition of it, in so far as implicit in existence is the concept. But because the absolute exists at first only implicitly, in itself, it equally is not the absolute nor the posited concept, and also not the idea, for the in-itself is only an abstract, one-sided moment, and this is what they are. The advance is not, therefore, a kind of superfluity; this is what it would be if that which is at the beginning were already the absolute; the advance consists rather in this, that the universal determines itself and is the universal for itself, that is, equally a singular and a subject. Only in its consummation is it the absolute.

### Concrete totality as beginning (lines 125-153)
**Germ and impulse**: It may also be mentioned that a beginning which is in itself a concrete totality may as such also be free and its immediacy have the determination of an external existence; the germ of anything living, and subjective purpose in general, have shown themselves to be such beginnings; hence both are themselves impulses. The non-spiritual and inanimate, on the contrary, are the concrete concept only as real possibility; cause is the highest stage in which the concrete concept has, as the beginning in the sphere of necessity, an immediate existence; but it is not yet a subject that maintains itself as such in the course of its effective realization. The sun, for instance, and in general all things inanimate, are determinate concrete existences in which real possibility remains an inner totality; the moments of the latter are not posited in them in subjective form and therefore, in so far as they are realized, they attain concrete existence through other corporeal individuals.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Method as Determinations of Concept**: Method = determinations of concept and connections. Beginning = simple nature. Content = immediate = abstract universality.

2. **Thought, Not Sense-Intuition**: Not sense-intuition/representation, but thought = supersensuous inner intuiting. Beginning = simple/universal in element of thought.

3. **Being as Abstract Self-Reference**: Universality = immediate universality = being (abstract self-reference). Being needs no derivation. Universal = immediate = abstract self-reference = being.

4. **Realization of Concept**: Demand for being exhibited = demand for realization of concept (goal of development).

5. **Beginning as Deficient**: Beginning = simple/universal (deficient). Universality = pure simple concept, only moment, concept not determined. Method objective/immanent: beginning has lack, impulse to carry further.

6. **Objective Universal**: Absolute method: universal = objective universal = concrete totality (not posited/for itself). Abstract universal = posited afflicted by negation. Nothing so simple/abstract.

7. **Absolute as Implicit**: Beginning = immediate = in-itself without being-for-itself. Every beginning = absolute (implicit in existence = concept). Absolute implicit = not absolute/not posited concept/not idea.

8. **Advance as Exposition**: Advance = universal determines itself = universal for itself = singular/subject. Consummation = absolute.

9. **Concrete Totality as Beginning**: Beginning in itself concrete totality = free, immediacy = external existence. Germ of living, subjective purpose = such beginnings = impulses.

10. **Real Possibility**: Non-spiritual/inanimate = concrete concept only as real possibility. Cause = highest stage in necessity, immediate existence, but not subject maintaining itself.

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Beginning as Simple and Universal** (abstract self-reference, being)
2. **Beginning as Deficient** (absolute as implicit)
3. **Advance as Exposition** (universal determines itself)
4. **Concrete Totality as Beginning** (germ, impulse)

## Transition Points

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: beginning as simple → beginning as deficient → concrete totality
- The key insight is that **every beginning must be made with the absolute, just as every advance is only the exposition of it**
- The beginning is deficient (simple and universal), but the absolute is implicit in it
- The advance consists in the universal determining itself and becoming the universal for itself
- This prepares the transition to The Advance
