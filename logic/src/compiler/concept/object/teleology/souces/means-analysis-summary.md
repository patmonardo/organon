## Overview

The Means is the middle term connecting subjective purpose with objective purpose. It shows how purpose realizes itself through external objects. Means is both external and internal to purpose. The first immediate positing in purpose is equally the positing of something internally determined, and at the same time the presupposing of an objective world, one indifferent to the determination of purpose. The second determining is the sublation of this presupposition as such. The object so determined is now the means. Through a means the purpose unites with objectivity and in objectivity unites with itself.

## Structure

### First positing and presupposing, second determining (lines 4-25)
**Sublation of presupposition**: The first immediate positing in purpose is equally the positing of something internally determined, that is, determined as posited, and, at the same time, the presupposing of an objective world, one indifferent to the determination of purpose. But the subjectivity of purpose is the absolutely negative unity; its second determining is, therefore, the sublation of this presupposition as such; this sublation is an immanent turning back inasmuch as that moment of the first negation which is the positing of the negative over against the subject, the external object, is sublated by it. But as against the presupposition or the immediacy of the determining, as against the objective world, it is as yet only the first, itself immediate and hence external negation. This positing is therefore not yet the realized purpose itself but only the beginning of this realization. The object so determined is now the means.

### Means as middle term, finitude of purpose (lines 27-54)
**Finitude and mediation**: Through a means the purpose unites with objectivity and in objectivity unites with itself. This means is the middle term of the syllogism. Purpose is in need of a means for its realization, because it is finite, in need of a means, that is to say, of a middle term that has at the same time the shape of an external existence indifferent towards the purpose itself and its realization. The absolute concept has mediation within itself in such a manner that the first positing of it is not a presupposition in whose object the fundamental determination would be an indifferent externality; on the contrary, the world as creation has only the form of such an externality; it is its negativity and the positedness that rather constitute its fundamental determination. Accordingly, the finitude of purpose consists in this, that its determining is as such external to itself; accordingly, its first determining, as we have seen, falls apart into a supposing and a presupposing; the negation of this determining is therefore only according to one side already immanent reflection; according to the other side, it is rather only first negation. Or again, the immanent reflection is itself also self-external and a reflection outwards.

### Means as formal middle term, external linkage (lines 56-78)
**External to extremes**: The means is therefore the formal middle term of a formal syllogism; it is something external to the extreme of the subjective purpose as also, therefore, to the extreme of the objective purpose; just as particularity in the formal syllogism is an indifferent medius terminus that can be replaced by others. Moreover, just as this particularity is a middle term by virtue of being determinateness with reference to one extreme but universality with reference to the other extreme, and therefore obtains its mediating determination by being related to an other, so too the means is a mediating middle term only because it is, first, an immediate object, and, second, because it is a means by virtue of a reference connecting it with the extreme of purpose external to it, a reference which is for it a form to which it is indifferent.

### Means as mechanical object, concept and objectivity externally linked (lines 79-123)
**Becoming-other**: Concept and objectivity, therefore, are in the means only externally linked; hence the means is only a merely mechanical object. The reference of the object to purpose is a premise or the immediate reference which, as we have seen, is with respect to purpose an immanent reflection; the means is an inhering predicate; its objectivity is subsumed under the determination of purpose which, on account of its concreteness, is universality. Through this purposive determination present in it, the means is now also subsumptive with respect to the other extreme, the at the moment still indeterminate objectivity. Conversely, as contrasted with the subjective purpose, the means has as immediate objectivity a universality of existence which the subjective singularity of purpose still misses. Thus, since purpose is in the means as only an external determinateness at first, it is itself, as the negative unity, outside the means; the means, for its part, is a mechanical object that possesses purpose only as a determinateness, not as the simple concretion of totality. But as the unifying means, the middle term must itself be the totality of the purpose. It has been shown that the determination of purpose is in the middle term at the same time immanent reflection; as this reflection, it is a formal self-reference, since the determinateness is posited as real indifference, as the objectivity of the middle term. But precisely for this reason this subjectivity, which is in one respect pure subjectivity, is at the same time also activity. In the subjective purpose the negative self-reference is still identical with determinateness as such, with the content and the externality. However, in the initial objectification of purpose which is a becoming-other of the simple concept, those moments come apart, each outside the other, or, conversely, the becoming-other or the externality itself consists in this coming apart.

### Means as totality, penetrable by purpose (lines 125-162)
**Powerless and serving**: This whole middle term is thus the totality of the syllogism in which the abstract activity and the external means constitute the extremes, while the determinateness of the object through the purpose, by virtue of which it is a means, constitutes the middle term. But further, universality is the connection of purposiveness and the means. This means is object, in itself the totality of the concept; it does not have with respect to purpose any of the power of resistance that it initially has against another immediate object. To the purpose, therefore, which is the posited concept, it is utterly penetrable, and it is receptive to this communication because it is in itself identical with it. But it is now also posited that it is penetrable by the concept, for in centrality it is an object striving towards negative unity; in chemism, too, whether as neutral or non-indifferent, it is no longer self-subsistent. Its non-self-subsistence consists precisely in its being the totality of the concept only implicitly; but the concept is being-for-itself. Consequently, with respect to purpose the object has the character of being powerless and of serving it; purpose is the subjectivity or soul of the object that has in the latter its external side.

### Activity through means still directed against presupposition (lines 163-181)
**Presupposition persists**: The object, immediately subjected to purpose in this way, is not an extreme of the syllogism; on the contrary, this connection between the two constitutes a premise of it. But the means has also one side from which it still has self-subsistence as against the purpose. The objectivity which in the means is bound with the purpose is still external to it, because it is only immediately so connected; and therefore the presupposition still persists. The activity of the purpose through the means is for that reason still directed against this presupposition, and the purpose is activity, no longer mere impulse and striving, because in the means the moment of objectivity is posited in its determinateness as something external, and the simple unity of the concept now has this objectivity as such within it.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **First Positing and Presupposing**: First immediate positing in purpose equally positing of something internally determined. Determined as posited, at same time presupposing objective world. Indifferent to determination of purpose.

2. **Second Determining as Sublation**: Subjectivity of purpose is absolutely negative unity. Second determining is sublation of presupposition as such. Sublation is immanent turning back. Moment of first negation which is positing of negative over against subject. External object sublated by it. As against presupposition or immediacy of determining, as against objective world, as yet only first, itself immediate and hence external negation. Positing not yet realized purpose itself. Only beginning of realization. **Object so determined is now the means**.

3. **Finitude of Purpose**: Purpose is in need of a means for its realization, because it is finite. Need of middle term that has shape of external existence. Indifferent towards purpose itself and its realization. Absolute concept has mediation within itself. Finitude of purpose consists in determining as such external to itself. First determining falls apart into supposing and presupposing. Negation of determining only according to one side already immanent reflection. According to other side rather only first negation. Immanent reflection itself also self-external and reflection outwards.

4. **Formal Middle Term**: Means is formal middle term of formal syllogism. Something external to extreme of subjective purpose. Also to extreme of objective purpose. Particularity in formal syllogism indifferent medius terminus replaceable by others. Particularity is middle term by virtue of being determinateness with reference to one extreme. Universality with reference to other extreme. Obtains mediating determination by being related to other. Means is mediating middle term only because: first, immediate object; second, means by virtue of reference connecting it with extreme of purpose external to it. Reference which is for it form to which it is indifferent.

5. **Mechanical Object**: Concept and objectivity in means only externally linked. Means only merely mechanical object. Reference of object to purpose is premise or immediate reference. With respect to purpose immanent reflection. Means is inhering predicate. Objectivity subsumed under determination of purpose. On account of concreteness, purpose is universality. Through purposive determination present in it, means also subsumptive with respect to other extreme. At moment still indeterminate objectivity.

6. **Becoming-Other**: In initial objectification of purpose which is becoming-other of simple concept, moments come apart, each outside other. Becoming-other or externality itself consists in coming apart.

7. **Totality and Penetrability**: Whole middle term is totality of syllogism. Abstract activity and external means constitute extremes. Determinateness of object through purpose constitutes middle term. Means is object, in itself totality of concept. Does not have with respect to purpose power of resistance. Initially has against another immediate object. To purpose, which is posited concept, utterly penetrable. Receptive to communication because in itself identical with it. Posited that penetrable by concept. In centrality object striving towards negative unity. In chemism, whether neutral or non-indifferent, no longer self-subsistent. Non-self-subsistence consists in being totality of concept only implicitly. Concept is being-for-itself. **With respect to purpose object has character of powerless and serving**. Purpose is subjectivity or soul of object. Has in latter external side.

8. **Presupposition Persists**: Object immediately subjected to purpose not extreme of syllogism. Connection between two constitutes premise. Means has one side from which still has self-subsistence as against purpose. Objectivity in means bound with purpose still external to it. Only immediately so connected, presupposition still persists. Activity of purpose through means still directed against presupposition. Purpose is activity, no longer mere impulse and striving. In means moment of objectivity posited in determinateness as something external. Simple unity of concept now has objectivity as such within it.

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: first positing → second determining → finitude → formal middle term → mechanical object → totality → presupposition persists
- The key insight is that **means is the middle term that unites purpose with objectivity**
- Means is both external (formal middle term) and internal (totality of concept, penetrable by purpose)
- The presupposition still persists—activity still directed against presupposition
- This prepares the transition to C. THE REALIZED PURPOSE
