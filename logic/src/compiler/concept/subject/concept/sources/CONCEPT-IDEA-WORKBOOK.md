# Concept Idea Workbook

Part: `IDEA. CHAPTER 1 — THE CONCEPT`
Status: active
Authority: original source text only

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `src/compiler/essence/reflection/foundation/sources/WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for this part.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact heading order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Clean-room rules

- Source authority is limited to Concept source files in this folder.
- Claims must be line-anchored.
- If uncertain, mark `review_pending` and capture an open question.
- Span boundaries must follow complete sentence groups (no mid-sentence start/end).

## TopicMap terminology contract

- Workbook = serialized artifact of one TopicMap.
- TopicMap = graph container (topics + typed relations) within the broader Knowledge Graph.
- Entry (Topic) = one topic node with id, title, key points, claims, and relations.
- Scope / section / span = textual referents for source inclusion boundaries.
- Chunk = informal analysis term only; do not use as a formal schema field.

## Working template

### Entry (Topic) <id> — <title>

- span: `<lineStart-lineEnd>`
- summary: one sentence
- keyPoints: (KeyPoint) 3-8 non-redundant points
- claims: (Claim) 1-3 minimum, with evidence
- relations: (Relation) typed only (`supports|contrasts|negates|sublates|presupposes|refines|transitions_to`), using labeled bullets (`r1`, `r2`, ...)

## Session: 2026-02-20 (initial scaffold)

Scope:

- files:
  - `samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex`
- focus: focused Chapter 1 study (`The concept`) as the Concept-as-such determination, with only the final boundary sentence that opens Judgment.

Decision:

- Keep this workbook Chapter 1 specific and concept-focused.
- Keep first-order claims anchored only to Chapter 1 lines in `samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex`.
- Treat this workbook as the focused Concept-IDEA map; place sphere-level (`Concept | Judgment | Syllogism`) coordination in `SUBJECT-IDEA-WORKBOOK.md`.
- Treat source text spans as authoritative Text Segments for Knowledge Graph ingestion.

### Entry con-idea-001 — Chapter 1 opening: concept as such beyond abstract understanding

Span:

- sourceFile: `src/compiler/concept/subject/sources/samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex`
- lineStart: 1428
- lineEnd: 1454

Summary:

The chapter opening distinguishes the concept as such from the merely determinate-concept function of understanding.

Key points: (KeyPoint)

- k1. Common doctrine reduces understanding to determinate concepts and separates it from judgment/reason.
- k2. Formal judgment and formal syllogism are treated as understanding when subsumed under abstract determinateness.
- k3. The chapter explicitly redefines the target as the concept as such, not merely abstractly determinate concept.

Claims: (Claim)

  - subject: concept_as_such
  - predicate: is_distinguished_from
  - object: merely_determinate_concept_of_understanding
  - modality: asserted
  - confidence: 0.97
  - evidence:
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1428-1441] understanding commonly taken as faculty of determinate concepts.
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1451-1454] explicit distinction: understanding as faculty of concept as such (not abstractly determined).

### Entry con-idea-002 — Universal concept as triadic totality (U/P/S)

Span:

- sourceFile: `src/compiler/concept/subject/sources/samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex`
- lineStart: 1456
- lineEnd: 1466

Summary:

The universal concept is explicitly articulated as universality, particularity, and singularity, with each moment carrying whole-concept status.

Key points: (KeyPoint)

- k1. The universal concept contains three moments: universality, particularity, singularity.
- k2. Positedness names the sides generated by conceptual self-distinguishing.
- k3. Each moment is both whole concept and determinate concept.

Claims: (Claim)

- c1. id: con-idea-002-c1
  - subject: universal_concept
  - predicate: contains
  - object: universality_particularity_singularity_as_three_moments
  - modality: asserted
  - confidence: 0.98
  - evidence:
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1456-1458] explicit triadic statement of moments.

- c2. id: con-idea-002-c2
  - subject: conceptual_positedness
  - predicate: entails
  - object: each_moment_as_total_and_determinate_concept
  - modality: asserted
  - confidence: 0.96
  - evidence:
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1459-1466] positedness and each moment as whole concept + determinate concept.

  - sourceKeyPointIds: [`k1`, `k3`]
  - targetClaimIds: [`con-idea-003-c1`]

### Entry con-idea-003 — Ordered self-determination: first universal, second particular, third singular

Span:

- sourceFile: `src/compiler/concept/subject/sources/samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex`
- lineStart: 1468
- lineEnd: 1491

Summary:

Chapter 1 orders the concept's moments as universal, then particular, then singular as reflective return into absolute negativity.

Key points: (KeyPoint)

- k1. The first moment is pure universality, yet already a determinate position among moments.
- k2. The second moment posits particularity as determinate distinctness.
- k3. The third moment is singularity as reflection out of difference into absolute negativity.

Claims: (Claim)

- c1. id: con-idea-003-c1
  - subject: concept_moment_order
  - predicate: proceeds_as
  - object: universal_then_particular_then_singular
  - modality: asserted
  - confidence: 0.97
  - evidence:
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1468-1487] first universal, second particular.
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1489-1491] third singularity as reflective return into absolute negativity.

- c2. id: con-idea-003-c2
  - subject: universal_moment
  - predicate: is_determined_as
  - object: self_identical_totality_that_self_distinguishes
  - modality: asserted
  - confidence: 0.93
  - evidence:
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1468-1483] universal moment as pure self-reference that determines/distinguishes itself against distinct moments.

Relations: (Relation)

- r1. type: supports
  - targetEntryId: con-idea-002
  - note: ordered exposition operationalizes the triadic structure stated in entry-002.

  - logicalOperator: implicative_support
  - analysisMode: first_order_claim_projection

- r2. type: transitions_to
  - targetEntryId: con-idea-004
  - note: third moment (singularity) transitions directly to the boundary clause that opens judgment.

  - sourceKeyPointIds: [`k1`, `k3`]
  - targetClaimIds: [`con-idea-004-c1`]

Review outcome:

### Entry con-idea-004 — Transition gate: singularity becomes judgment

Span:

- sourceFile: `src/compiler/concept/subject/sources/samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex`
- lineStart: 1492
- lineEnd: 1494

Summary:

The third moment concludes with singularity stepping into otherness and becoming judgment.

Key points: (KeyPoint)

- k1. The third moment is singularity as reflective return into negativity.
- k2. This singularity steps out of identity into otherness.
- k3. The immediate consequence is becoming judgment.

Claims: (Claim)

- c1. id: con-idea-004-c1
  - subject: singularity_moment
  - predicate: is_posited_as
  - object: transition_into_judgment
  - modality: asserted
  - confidence: 0.96
  - evidence:
    - [samyama-greater-subjectivity.tex:1491-1493] singularity stepping into otherness becomes judgment.

Relations: (Relation)

- r1. type: transitions_to
  - targetEntryId: sub-idea-judgment-001
  - note: closes Chapter 1 by marking the explicit transition boundary into the Subject-IDEA judgment track.
  - sourceClaimIds: [`con-idea-004-c1`]
  - sourceKeyPointIds: [`k1`, `k2`, `k3`]
  - targetClaimIds: [`sub-idea-judgment-001-c1`]

Review outcome:

- review_pending
- notes: boundary claim kept minimal to match explicit Chapter 1 wording.
