# Absolute Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: chapter-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Actuality/Absolute.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the "view from above" framing for the Absolute chapter stack:

- exposition of the absolute as self-grounding identity,
- attribute as relative absolute and reflective determination,
- mode as self-manifesting movement culminating in actuality.

It does **not** replace Part A/B/C entry analysis; those remain in the dedicated part workbooks.

## Source map (Actuality / Absolute)

- `A. THE EXPOSITION OF THE ABSOLUTE` (`exposition.txt`)
- `B. THE ABSOLUTE ATTRIBUTE` (`attribute.txt`)
- `C. THE MODE OF THE ABSOLUTE` (`mode.txt`)

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. THE EXPOSITION OF THE ABSOLUTE` -> see `ABSOLUTE-PART-A-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. THE ABSOLUTE ATTRIBUTE` -> see `ABSOLUTE-PART-B-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. THE MODE OF THE ABSOLUTE` -> see `ABSOLUTE-PART-C-WORKBOOK.md`
