# Actuality Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: chapter-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `../../absolute/WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Actuality/Actuality.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the "view from above" framing for the Actuality chapter stack:

- contingency as formal actuality/possibility/necessity,
- relative necessity as real actuality/possibility/necessity,
- absolute necessity as unity of necessity and contingency resolving toward substance.

It does **not** replace Part A/B/C entry analysis; those remain in the dedicated part workbooks.

## Part decomposition for detailed study

## Transition anchor

### Entry act-idea-001 — Substance as next-determination handoff
