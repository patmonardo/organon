# Source Analysis Summary: contingency.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage

- **Chunks Extracted**: 10
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `act-a-1` | Formal actuality — contains possibility | 3-13 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-2` | Possibility as actuality reflected into itself — two moments | 15-32 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-3` | Formal possibility — contradiction, impossibility | 34-53 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-4` | "It is possible" says nothing — principle of identity | 55-72 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-5` | Possible more than identity — ought-to-be, contradiction | 74-92 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-6` | Possibility contains its other — becomes actuality | 94-124 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-7` | Reflected actuality — unity with possibility | 126-149 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-8` | Contingency — two sides, groundless and grounded | 151-226 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-9` | Absolute restlessness — necessity | 184-216 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-a-10` | Necessity — contingent is necessary | 218-242 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Numbered structure (1., 2., 3.) properly captured

### Note on Overlap
- Chunks 8 and 9 overlap (lines 184-216). This is intentional as chunk 9 develops the "absolute restlessness" aspect that begins in chunk 8, representing a logical development within the same material.

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (relative-necessity.txt, absolute-necessity.txt)
