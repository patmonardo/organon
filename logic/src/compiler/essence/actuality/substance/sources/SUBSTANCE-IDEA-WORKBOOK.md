# Substance Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: chapter-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `../../absolute/WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Actuality/Substance.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the "view from above" framing for the Substance chapter stack:

- substantiality as substance/accident relation,
- causality as cause-effect and mediated causal relation,
- reciprocity of action as sublation of one-sided finite causality.

It does **not** replace Part A/B/C entry analysis; those remain in the dedicated part workbooks.

## Source map (Actuality / Substance)

- `A. THE RELATION OF SUBSTANTIALITY` (`relation-substantiality.txt`)
- `B. THE RELATION OF CAUSALITY` (`relation-causality.txt`)
- `C. RECIPROCITY OF ACTION` (`reciprocity-action.txt`)

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. THE RELATION OF SUBSTANTIALITY` -> see `SUBSTANCE-PART-A-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. THE RELATION OF CAUSALITY` -> see `SUBSTANCE-PART-B-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. RECIPROCITY OF ACTION` -> see `SUBSTANCE-PART-C-WORKBOOK.md`
