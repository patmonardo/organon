### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID   | Title                                                 | Source Lines | Status     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| `sub-b-1`  | Substance as power — cause and effect                 | 3-15         | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-2`  | Formal causality — cause is originative               | 19-67        | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-3`  | Cause has actuality only in effect — necessity        | 69-113       | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-4`  | Effect contains nothing cause does not — identity     | 115-133      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-5`  | Identity extinguished — immediacy                     | 135-146      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-6`  | Determinate causality — content and form              | 150-180      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-7`  | Analytic proposition — same content                   | 182-197      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-8`  | Examples — rain, color, act, movement                 | 198-225      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-9`  | Contingent side-being — inadmissible applications     | 227-340      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-10` | Substrate and substance — finite causality            | 342-399      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-11` | Infinite regress — finite causality                   | 436-512      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-12` | Action and reaction — passive and efficient substance | 567-606      | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sub-b-13` | Violence and power — reaction                         | 608-778      | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching

- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found in chunked sections
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ⚠️ Gap at lines 514-563 needs to be addressed

### Logical Flow

- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ⚠️ Gap at lines 514-563 interrupts flow between chunk 11 and chunk 12
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in infinite reciprocal action

### Issues Found

#### ⚠️ Missing Section: Lines 514-563

**Section**: "3. We now have to see what has resulted from the movement of determinate causality"

**Content**: This section discusses:

- How formal causality expires in the effect
- The element of identity emerging as implicit unity
- How cause and effect become both cause and effect
- The outcome: cause comes to be again in effect, effect comes to be again in cause
- Causality pre-supposes itself or conditions itself
- Leads into the section on action and reaction

**Recommendation**: This section should be added as a new chunk (e.g., `sub-b-12-outcome-determinate-causality`) or merged into chunk 11 or chunk 12. It represents an important logical development that bridges determinate causality and action/reaction.

### Recommendations

- ⚠️ **Address the gap**: Add chunk for lines 514-563 or integrate into existing chunks
- ✓ Chunking is otherwise complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis (with noted gap)

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete (with noted gap)
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → **Address gap**: Add chunk for lines 514-563
4. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
5. → Move to next species (reciprocity-action.txt)
