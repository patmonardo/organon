# World Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: chapter-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Appearance/World.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the "view from above" framing for the Appearance/World chapter stack:

- law of appearance as enduring self-identity of appearing flux,
- opposition of world of appearance and world-in-itself,
- dissolution of that opposition into essential relation.

It does **not** do Part A/B/C entry analysis; those are separate workbooks.

## Source map (Appearance / World)

- `A. THE LAW OF APPEARANCE` (`law.txt`)
- `B. THE WORLD OF APPEARANCE AND THE WORLD-IN-ITSELF` (`world.txt`)
- `C. THE DISSOLUTION OF APPEARANCE` (`disappearance.txt`)

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. THE LAW OF APPEARANCE` -> see `WORLD-PART-A-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. THE WORLD OF APPEARANCE AND THE WORLD-IN-ITSELF` -> planned `WORLD-PART-B-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. THE DISSOLUTION OF APPEARANCE` -> planned `WORLD-PART-C-V2-WORKBOOK.md`

## Session log

### Session: 2026-02-19

- Decision: initialize local World/Appearance contract + workbook stack in this folder.
