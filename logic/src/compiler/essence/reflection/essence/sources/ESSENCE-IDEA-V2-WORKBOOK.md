# Essence Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: Section/Chapter-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the "view from above" framing:

- Section architecture
- Chapter architecture
- explicit triadic enumerations (`First / Second / Third`)

It does **not** do Part A/B/C entry analysis; those are separate workbooks.

## Source map (Essence / Reflection Within)

- Section: `SECTION I — Essence as Reflection Within`
- Chapter: `CHAPTER 1 — Shine`

## Chapter 1 Idea marker

`CHAPTER 1 — Shine` contains explicit Idea-level triadic framing:

1. immediate being as unessential
2. being void of essence as shine
3. shine as essence's own shining (reflection)

Reason this is Idea-level: the text gives a top-order conceptual overview before Part-level development.

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. THE ESSENTIAL AND THE UNESSENTIAL` -> see `ESSENCE-PART-A-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. SHINE` -> see `ESSENCE-PART-B-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. REFLECTION` -> see `ESSENCE-PART-C-V2-WORKBOOK.md`

## Session log

### Session: 2026-02-17

- Decision: maintain a dedicated Idea workbook separate from Part A/B/C analysis.
- Decision: treat `First/Second/Third` enumerations as chapter-level Idea anchors.
