    ABSTRACT COGNITIVE AFFINITY PROCESS PATTERNS:

    1. AFFINITY AND NEUTRAL MEDIUM:
    - Objects in cognitive tension (internal contradiction + external affinity)
    - Middle term medium (implicitly existent nature + formal element)
    - Water (bodies) and Language (spirit) as universal mediums
    - Tranquil communication → Negative relating → Reciprocal complementation
    - Neutral product (temporary resolution, formal unity)

    2. SELF-SUBSISTENT NEGATIVITY:
    - Unity steps outside neutral object (process driver becomes external)
    - Process doesn't spontaneously restart (requires external driver)
    - Self-subsistent negativity as "restless activity bent on consuming"
    - Immediate connection → Object disrupted → Disjunctive syllogism
    - Totality of chemism (negative unity → real unity → abstract moments)

    3. ELEMENTAL LIBERATION:
    - Elemental objects liberated from chemical tension
    - Inner determinateness as essential contradiction
    - Outward impulse to create tension and seek neutralization
    - Chemism returns to beginning (circular process)
    - Chemism sublates itself → Transition to higher sphere (Teleology)

    This IS the abstract process of all cognitive affinity dynamics!
    Water and Language as paradigmatic cognitive mediums!

    RESULT: Chemism returns to beginning but sublates itself

    This IS the complete abstract process of cognitive affinity dynamics:
    - Affinities seek actualization through abstract mediums
    - Water and Language as universal cognitive mediation principles
    - Process is self-renewing through external negativity
    - Returns to beginning at higher level → Teleological cognition
