/**
 * THE JUDGMENT OF THE CONCEPT: VRITTI-NIRODHA as Absolute Conceptual Self-Determination
 * ====================================================================================
 *
 * The final and highest sphere of Judgment where the concept emerges as
 * self-determining measure of reality. This represents VRITTI-NIRODHA achieving
 * absolute conceptual self-determination while still in judgment form - the
 * concept as OUGHT measuring actuality for conformity. The movement from
 * subjective assertion through problematic questioning to apodictic necessity
 * as complete conceptual self-legislation.
 *
 * The Concept Structure as Complete CITTA-VRITTI Self-Legislation:
 * - Assertoric: "This action is good" (concept as immediate measure)
 * - Problematic: "Whether this conforms to concept?" (concept as questioning principle)
 * - Apodictic: "As so constituted, this is necessarily good" (concept as absolute measure)
 * This is consciousness achieving complete self-legislative authority over experience
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. Assertoric Judgment: Concept as immediate ought (subjective assurance)
 * 2. Problematic Judgment: Concept as questioning principle (contingency exposed)
 * 3. Apodictic Judgment: Concept as absolute measure (necessity through constitution)
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - DHARMA-MEGHA-SAMADHI: Consciousness as absolute dharmic legislation
 * - RTAMBHARA-PRAJNA: Truth-bearing wisdom as conceptual measure
 * - VIVEKA-KHYATI: Discriminative understanding as absolute standard
 * - KAIVALYA-PRATYABHIJNA: Recognition of absolute conceptual independence
 * - PURNA-SVATANTRATA: Complete conceptual self-determination
 *
 * "This is the judgment, therefore, that first contains true adjudication;
 * the predicates, 'good,' 'bad,' 'true,' 'right,' etc., express that the fact
 * is measured against the concept as an ought" - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Three: The Concept - Chapter 2, D. The Judgment of the Concept

    The Three-fold Conceptual Development:

       - DHARMA-ABHIJNA: Righteous recognition without complete grounding

    FROM IMMEDIATE ASSERTION THROUGH QUESTIONING TO ABSOLUTE NECESSITY:

    The Progressive Self-Legislative Development:

    Immediate Assertion (Assertoric):
    - "This house is bad" (concept as immediate ought)
    - "This meditation is pure" (immediate conceptual measure)
    - SAKSHATKARA-ABHAVA: Lack of immediate systematic evidence
    - Subjective assurance without systematic grounding

    Critical Questioning (Problematic):
    - "Is this house really bad or good?" (concept as questioning principle)
    - "Is this meditation truly pure or impure?" (systematic doubt)
    - SANDEHA-BUDDHI: Doubting intelligence as conceptual function
    - The concept questioning adequacy of its own immediate application

    Absolute Necessity (Apodictic):
    - "This house, as so constituted, is necessarily bad" (constitution-grounding)
    - "This meditation, as so practiced, is necessarily pure" (systematic necessity)
    - SVATANTRA-NISHCHAYA: Independent determination through constitution
    - The concept as self-grounding absolute legislative authority

    The Philosophical Significance:
    - Movement from dogmatic through skeptical to critical conceptual authority
    - PRAMANA-SIDDHI: Authority-accomplishment through self-critical development
    - Each stage preparing more adequate conceptual self-determination
    - Complete systematic self-legislative consciousness achieved

    The Qualitative Leap:

    Mere Description (Existence/Reflection/Necessity):
    - "The rose is red" (immediate quality)
    - "This is universal" (relational property)
    - "All animals are mortal" (systematic necessity)

    Why Previous Judgments Subjective:
    - Existence: Abstract one-sidedness losing concept
    - Reflection: External relationships without conceptual grounding
    - Necessity: Systematic relationships without conceptual self-determination

    - SVATANTRA-NISHCHAYA: Independent determination through conceptual nature
    - PURNA-OBJEKTIFATA: Complete objectivity through conceptual self-transparency

    The Achievement:
    - Genuine objectivity through complete conceptual self-determination
    - TATTVA-SATTA: Essential existence as objective truth
    - Not subjective opinion but objective conceptual necessity
    - VISHAYA-SVARUPA: Object-essence as conceptual self-determination
