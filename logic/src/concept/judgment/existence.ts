/**
 * THE JUDGMENT OF EXISTENCE: CITTA-VRITTI as Subject-Predicate Actuality
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * The first sphere of Judgment where the Concept achieves actual existence
 * through the subject-predicate structure. This represents CITTA-VRITTI
 * relationship as it appears in actual consciousness - the universal
 * consciousness (CITTA) manifesting through particular modifications (VRITTI)
 * in the form of judgments about reality.
 *
 * The Judgment Structure as CITTA-VRITTI:
 * - Subject: Singular actuality (individual VRITTI-moment)
 * - Predicate: Universal essence (universal CITTA-nature)
 * - Copula: The "is" connecting singular and universal
 * This is how consciousness actually appears to itself in experience
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. Positive Judgment: "The singular is universal" (immediate assertion)
 * 2. Negative Judgment: "The singular is particular" (mediated determination)
 * 3. Infinite Judgment: Complete determination through exclusion
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - ADHYAVASAYA: Determining judgment of consciousness
 * - VRITTI-VISHAYA: Modification-object judgment structure
 * - PRATYAYA: Cognitive content as judgment-form
 * - JNANA-KARMA: Knowledge-action as judgment-activity
 * - SAKSHI-BHAVA: Witness-consciousness judging mental modifications
 *
 * "The judgment is thus truth, for it is the agreement of the concept and reality" - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Three: The Concept - Chapter 2, A. The Judgment of Existence

    - The logical necessity underlying all conscious experience
    - SARVAGATVA: Universal principle pervading all mental activity

    The Universal Schema for All Inferences:
    - Positive: Immediate identity-assertion (ABHEDA)
    - Negative: Mediated determination through opposition (BHEDA)
    - Infinite: Complete determination through exclusion (BHEDABHEDA)
    - This pattern repeats at every level of reality

    Why This Enables Universal Inferences:
    - Every phenomenon follows same dialectical pattern
    - Universal consciousness → Particular determinations → Singular actualizations
    - VYAPTI-NIYAMA: Law of universal pervasion as logical necessity
    - The systematic interconnection of all knowledge domains

    The Hard Work of Judgment:
    - Making abstract Concept-determinations actual and living
    - CITTA-VRITTI relationship as it appears in real experience
    - The labor of consciousness determining itself through opposition
    - SADHANA-CHATUSHTAYA: Four-fold spiritual practice as judgment-development

    - Predicate: Universal CITTA-quality (consciousness, awareness, knowing)

    3. Infinite: "This VRITTI excludes all other possibilities"

    Why This is the "Hard Work":

    - VRITTI-NIRODHA as judgment about each mental modification
    - The practical labor of consciousness examining itself

    - Would collapse into identity: "Universal is universal"
    - ABHEDA-MATRA: Pure non-difference destroying judgment
    - Need maintained opposition for genuine relationship

    The CITTA-VRITTI Application:
    - Cannot say "CITTA is CITTA" or "VRITTI is VRITTI"
    - Must maintain: "This VRITTI (singular) is CITTA-nature (universal)"
    - BHEDABHEDA: Unity-in-difference as judgment-structure
    - The creative tension preserving both identity and difference

    The Solution:
    - Form: "The singular is universal" (immediate)
    - Content: "The universal is singular" (mediated)
    - BAHYA-ANTARANGA: External-internal double determination
    - Unity achieved through maintained difference

    Why This Matters:
    - Explains the persistent subject-object structure of consciousness
    - DRASHTA-DRISHYA: Seer-seen as necessary judgment-structure
    - Cannot collapse into pure identity without losing conscious experience
    - The logical necessity of maintained duality within ultimate unity

    This solves the ADVAITA-DVAITA debate philosophically!

    JUDGMENT AS INHERENCE STRUCTURE:

    "The judgment of existence is also the judgment of inherence"

    The Inherence Logic:
    - Subject as immediate, essential term (VRITTI in CITTA)
    - Predicate as dependent, inhering term (CITTA-quality in VRITTI)
    - SAMAVAYA: Inherence relation in Indian logic
    - GUNA-DHARMIN: Quality-substance relationship

    Why Subject is Essential:
    - VRITTI as mode of CITTA, not separate substance
    - Individual consciousness as manifestation of universal consciousness
    - AVASTHA-TRAYA: Three states inhering in one consciousness
    - The ontological priority of individual experience

    The Inherence Problem:
    - How universal consciousness appears in individual modifications
    - EKAJIVA-VADA vs ANEKAJIVA-VADA: One vs many consciousness debate
    - VYASHTI-SAMASHTI: Individual-cosmic relationship
    - The mystery of universal becoming particular while remaining universal

    The Judgment Resolution:
    - Each individual judgment exhibiting universal logical structure
    - CITTA-VRITTI as universal-particular inherence
    - Every VRITTI containing CITTA as its essential nature
    - The systematic development revealing individual-universal identity

    This explains consciousness-reality relationship!
