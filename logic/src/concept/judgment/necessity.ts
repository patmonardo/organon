/**
 * THE JUDGMENT OF NECESSITY: VRITTI-NIRODHA as Systematic Logical Necessity
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * The third and highest sphere of Judgment where logical necessity emerges
 * from essential determination. This represents VRITTI-NIRODHA at its most
 * systematic level - where the necessary relationships within consciousness
 * become logically transparent and self-determining. The movement from
 * external contingency through conditional necessity to absolute systematic
 * necessity as complete self-determination.
 *
 * The Necessity Structure as Complete CITTA-VRITTI System:
 * - Categorical: "VRITTI is CITTA-modification" (substantial identity)
 * - Hypothetical: "If VRITTI, then CITTA-determination" (conditional necessity)
 * - Disjunctive: "CITTA is either VRITTI-A or VRITTI-B or..." (systematic totality)
 * This is consciousness achieving complete systematic self-transparency
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. Categorical Judgment: Substantial identity (genus-species)
 * 2. Hypothetical Judgment: Conditional necessity (if-then relations)
 * 3. Disjunctive Judgment: Systematic totality (either-or completeness)
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - NIYATA-SAMBANDHA: Necessary relationship vs contingent connection
 * - SVABHAVA-NIYAMA: Essential nature as necessity
 * - KRAMA-NIYAMA: Systematic order as logical necessity
 * - PURNA-VIVEKA: Complete discrimination through systematic necessity
 * - SARVA-JNATA-JNEYA: Knower-known systematic completeness
 *
 * "The concept is this: that this identity is posited; that the existent
 * is not abstract self-identity but concrete self-identity" - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Three: The Concept - Chapter 2, C. The Judgment of Necessity

    2. Categorical Judgment: Substantial identity (genus-species)
    ${this.categoricalJudgment.dialecticalMovement()}

    3. Hypothetical Judgment: Conditional necessity (if-then relations)
    ${this.hypotheticalJudgment.dialecticalMovement()}

    4. Disjunctive Judgment: Systematic totality (either-or completeness)
    ${this.disjunctiveJudgment.dialecticalMovement()}

    5. Transition to Concept: Copula as concept itself posited

    VRITTI-NIRODHA AS COMPLETE LOGICAL NECESSITY:

    The Three-fold Necessity Development:

    1. Categorical: "VRITTI is CITTA-modification" (substantial identity)
       - Essential nature relationships
       - JATI-DHARMA: Species-essence as necessary predicate
       - "Mental states are consciousness-modifications" (not accidental properties)

    2. Hypothetical: "If VRITTI, then CITTA-determination" (conditional necessity)
       - Systematic interdependence of all mental determinations
       - "If thought, then awareness" (logical conditional necessity)
       - PRATITYASAMUTPADA: Dependent origination as logical structure

    3. Disjunctive: "CITTA is either BUDDHI or AHAMKARA or MANAS" (systematic totality)
       - Complete systematic exhaustion of consciousness-determinations
       - "Consciousness is either knowing or feeling or willing" (complete division)
       - PURNA-VIBHAGA: Complete systematic division of mental activity

    The Logical Achievement:
    - Complete systematic transparency of consciousness-structure
    - SARVA-VRITTI-NIYAMA: Necessity governing all mental modifications
    - PURNA-VIVEKA: Complete discrimination through logical necessity
    - TANTRA-SIDDHI: Systematic completion enabling conceptual freedom

    This IS the complete logical foundation of YOGA-DARSHANA!

    FROM SUBSTANTIAL TO CONDITIONAL TO SYSTEMATIC NECESSITY:

    The Progressive Development:

    Substantial Necessity (Categorical):
    - "Humans are rational" (essential nature)
    - "Gold is metal" (substantial identity)
    - SVABHAVA-DHARMA: Essential nature as necessary predicate
    - Inner necessity not yet developed in form

    Conditional Necessity (Hypothetical):
    - "If rational, then capable of freedom" (logical conditional)
    - "If consciousness, then self-awareness" (systematic relationship)
    - HETU-PHALA-NIYAMA: Cause-effect as logical necessity
    - Form-relationships explicitly developed

    Systematic Necessity (Disjunctive):
    - "Rationality is either theoretical or practical or aesthetic" (complete system)
    - "Consciousness is either cognitive or conative or affective" (systematic totality)
    - PURNA-TANTRIKA: Complete systematic determination
    - Absolute logical transparency achieved

    The Philosophical Significance:
    - Movement from essence through relationship to system
    - TATTVA → SAMBANDHA → TANTRA: Essence → Relationship → System
    - Each stage preparing the next in logical necessity
    - Complete systematic understanding as foundation for conceptual freedom

    This explains the systematic progression of all genuine knowledge!

    EMPIRICAL VS LOGICAL SYSTEMATIC DIVISION:

    "Color is either violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, or red;
    even empirically, the confusion and impurity of such a disjunction
    are at once apparent; it is a barbarism even from this standpoint"

    Why Empirical Divisions Inadequate:
    - No systematic principle governing the division
    - External collection without internal logical necessity
    - ASAMYAK-KRAMA: Improper systematic arrangement
    - Missing the determinateness constituting either-or principle

    Logical Division Requirements:
    - Internal principle determining systematic division
    - "Color as concrete unity of light and darkness" provides systematic principle
    - NIYAMA-MULAKA: Root-principle as basis for systematic division
    - Each member necessarily related to others through governing principle

    Examples of Logical Division:
    - Consciousness: Cognitive-Conative-Affective (based on subject-object relationship)
    - Being: Quality-Quantity-Measure (based on determinateness principle)
    - VRITTI: Pramana-Viparyaya-Vikalpa-Nidra-Smriti (based on object-relationship)

    The Scientific Implication:
    - True scientific classification vs mere empirical enumeration
    - SHASTRA-KRAMA vs LAUKIKA-SAMUDAYA: Scientific order vs worldly collection
    - Why YOGA-SUTRAS superior to psychological case-studies
    - The necessity of systematic principle for genuine scientific division

    This distinguishes genuine science from mere empirical collection!

    PROXIMATE GENUS AND SYSTEMATIC ADEQUACY:

    "Through the identity just demonstrated of subject and predicate
    in accordance with the negative unity, the genus is determined
    in the disjunctive judgment as the proximate genus"

    Proximate vs Remote Genus:
    - Remote genus: External universal without determinative principle
    - Proximate genus: Contains its own principle of systematic division
    - SANNIKRISHTA-JATI: Immediate species-essence containing division-principle
    - ANTARANGA-VIBHEDAKA: Internal differentiating principle

    Why Adequacy Matters:
    - Genus must contain determinateness constituting either-or
    - "Animal" adequate for "rational/irrational" division
    - "Being" adequate for "quality/quantity/measure" division
    - NIYAMA-YOGA: Unity of universal and its systematic division-principle

    Examples of Adequate Division:
    - Consciousness → Cognitive/Conative/Affective
    - CITTA → BUDDHI/AHAMKARA/MANAS
    - VRITTI → Pramana/Viparyaya/Vikalpa/Nidra/Smriti
    - Each genus containing its own systematic division-principle

    The Systematic Achievement:
    - Complete adequacy of universal to particular determination
    - PURNA-VYAPTI: Complete pervasion of universal in particulars
    - SAMARASATA: Essential unity of genus and species-differentiation
    - The foundation for absolute conceptual systematicity

    This is the logical foundation of complete scientific systematicity!

    CONCEPT AS POSITED IN COPULA - TRANSITION TO FREEDOM:

    "This unity, the copula of this judgment in which the extremes
    have come together through their identity, is thus the concept
    itself, indeed the concept as posited"

    The Great Transition:
    - Copula evolution: Being → Essence → Necessity → Concept
    - Not external connection but concept itself as self-determining unity
    - SVATANTRA-AIKYA: Independent unity as conceptual self-determination
    - The emergence of absolute conceptual freedom

    From Necessity to Freedom:
    - Complete necessity achieved = foundation for genuine freedom
    - NIYAMA-MUKTI: Freedom through complete systematic necessity
    - Not arbitrary freedom but conceptually determined freedom
    - PURNA-SVATANTRATA: Complete independence through complete determination

    The Copula as Concept:
    - Subject-predicate unity as conceptual self-consciousness
    - ABHEDA-BODHA: Non-difference awareness as conceptual activity
    - PURNA-PRATYABHIJNA: Complete self-recognition as conceptual freedom
    - The transition from logical necessity to conceptual spontaneity

    Ready for JUDGMENT OF THE CONCEPT:
    - Assertoric: Concept determining reality
    - Problematic: Concept questioning reality
    - Apodictic: Concept as absolute reality
    - The final sphere of judgment as conceptual self-determination

    This IS the logical foundation of absolute conceptual freedom!
