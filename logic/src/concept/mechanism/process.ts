    THE PROCESS PATTERN:
    Object â Communication â Reaction â Product
    â         â              â         â
    Maya â Universal â Particular â Singular/Truth

    FORMAL LEVEL:
    - Communication: Universal spreads without opposition
    - Reaction: Particularity asserts itself against universal
    - Rest: Return to indifferent object totality

    REAL LEVEL:
    - Power difference creates communication conditions
    - Violence occurs when power not recognized as own nature
    - Fate manifests as objective universality overriding particularity

    PRODUCT LEVEL:
    - Center: Objective unity as individual self-subsistence
    - Law: Rational universality replacing blind fate
    - Foundation: Truth and ground of mechanical process

    This IS the logical structure of how consciousness processes through
    and transcends the Maya of apparent externality!
