/**
 * IDENTITY: The First Determination of Reflection (CITTA)
 * =======================================================
 *
 * Identity as the first operation of CITTA (reflective consciousness).
 * This is NOT abstract logical identity (A = A) but ESSENTIAL identity -
 * the self-equality of reflection as pure self-production.
 *
 * In the context of CITTA as reflective consciousness:
 * - Identity is how mind relates to itself as pure self-reference
 * - "Simple self-reference, pure identity"
 * - The foundational logical law as living mental operation
 *
 * "This self-identity is the immediacy of reflection.
 * It is not that self-equality which being is, or also nothing,
 * but a self-equality which, in producing itself as unity,
 * does not produce itself over again, as from another,
 * but is a pure production, from itself and in itself,
 * essential identity." - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Two: Essence - Chapter 2, A. Identity
