### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `rm-a-intro` | Introduction — self-subsistent measures | 3-11 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-a` | (a) Whole immediate — external combination | 13-20 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-b` | (b) Self-subsistent materialities — affinity | 22-27 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-c-intro` | (c) Elective affinity — exclusive being-for-itself | 29-32 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-a-1` | Measure relation — weight to volume, direct ratio | 36-61 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-a-2` | Exponent — inner measure, subject to alteration | 63-95 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-a-3` | Compound — weight sum, volume alteration, space idealization | 97-137 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-a-4` | Measure not stable — determinateness in other measure-relations | 139-145 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-b-1` | Independence and union — preserving through quantitative indifference | 149-171 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-b-2` | Series of exponents — comparative numbers, unit and amounts | 173-270 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-b-3` | Return to degree — exclusive unit, elective affinity | 271-323 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-c-1` | Chemical and musical examples — exclusive affinities | 327-368 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-a-c-2` | Quantitative vs qualitative — sudden conversion | 370-430 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Numbered sections (a., b., c., 1., 2., 3.) properly aligned

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in sudden conversion (transition to next section)

### Key Concepts
- **Self-subsistent measures**: No longer immediate, becoming specified relations
- **Whole immediate**: External combination of independent measures
- **Affinity**: Non-indifferent quantitative connection
- **Elective affinity**: Exclusive being-for-itself
- **Measure relation**: Weight to volume, specifically determined gravity, direct ratio
- **Exponent**: Inner measure, subject to alteration, reciprocal specification
- **Compound**: Weight sum preserved, volume alteration, space as idealization
- **Series of exponents**: Comparative numbers, unit and amounts, characteristic series
- **Exclusive unit**: Return to degree, negation of negation, elective affinity
- **Chemical and musical examples**: Exclusive affinities, harmony/disharmony
- **Sudden conversion**: Quantitative ↔ qualitative, specifically determinate ↔ external relation

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (nodal-lines.txt)
