## Source Analysis: Line-by-Line Verification

### Chunk 1: Introduction — self-subsistent measures
**ID**: `rm-a-intro-self-subsistent-measures`
**Source Lines**: 3-11
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "By measures we no longer mean now"
- Ends: "and at first material."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about measures no longer immediate but self-subsistent, becoming specified relations within themselves, being-for-itself, something physical and material.

### Chunk 2: (a) Whole immediate — external combination
**ID**: `rm-a-a-whole-immediate`
**Source Lines**: 13-20
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "(a) However, the whole,"
- Ends: "and are posited in combination externally."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about whole as relation of measures being at first immediate, two sides as independent measures having subsistence in things external to each other, posited in combination externally.

### Chunk 3: (b) Self-subsistent materialities — affinity
**ID**: `rm-a-b-self-subsistent-materialities`
**Source Lines**: 22-27
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "(b) But the self-subsistent materialities are"
- Ends: "they are the members of a series of such quantitative relations."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about self-subsistent materialities being what they qualitatively are only in virtue of quantitative determination as measures, posited as non-indifferent (affinity), members of series of quantitative relations.

### Chunk 4: (c) Elective affinity — exclusive being-for-itself
**ID**: `rm-a-c-elective-affinity-intro`
**Source Lines**: 29-32
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "(c) This indifferent multifarious relating"
- Ends: "the so-called elective affinity."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about indifferent multifarious relating concluding by cutting itself off as exclusive being-for-itself: elective affinity.

### Chunk 5: Measure relation — weight to volume, direct ratio
**ID**: `rm-a-a-1-measure-relation-direct-ratio`
**Source Lines**: 36-61
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "As a measure relation, something is in itself determined by"
- Ends: "determined in the ordinary exponent of a direct ratio."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about measure relation: something determined by quanta with qualities (in-itselfness/material vs externality/space), quantitatively determined, ratio of weight to volume (specifically determined gravity). Volume = unit, intensive aspect = amount. Ratio of powers disappeared, immediacy returned, determinateness = quantum in ordinary exponent of direct ratio.

### Chunk 6: Exponent — inner measure, subject to alteration
**ID**: `rm-a-a-2-exponent-inner-measure`
**Source Lines**: 63-95
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "This exponent is the specific quantum of the something,"
- Ends: "and indeed a reciprocal specification."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about exponent = specific quantum (immediate, determined by comparison with other exponents). Exponent = inner measure characteristic, but rests on quantum = external and indifferent determinateness, subject to alteration. Other = quantum which is also exponent of specific ratio. Two things of different inner measure: each preserves itself, but self-preservation = negative relating, specification, alteration of measure itself = reciprocal specification.

### Chunk 7: Compound — weight sum, volume alteration, space idealization
**ID**: `rm-a-a-3-compound-volume-alteration`
**Source Lines**: 97-137
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "According to its merely quantitative determination,"
- Ends: "an idealization."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about compound: quantitatively would be sum of magnitudes, but only weight = sum (side capable of addition, stability, permanent immediate quantum). Alteration falls in exponents (qualitative side, being-for-itself). Immanent determining appears in other quality (idealized side). Mixing diverse materials: alteration of total volume (diminution). Space = stability but in face of negativity = alterable, idealization.

### Chunk 8: Measure not stable — determinateness in other measure-relations
**ID**: `rm-a-a-4-measure-not-stable`
**Source Lines**: 139-145
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "But then, not only is one of the qualitative sides"
- Ends: "its determinateness in other measure-relations."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about measure itself posited as alterable, qualitative determinateness not stable within but has determinateness in other measure-relations.

### Chunk 9: Independence and union — preserving through quantitative indifference
**ID**: `rm-a-b-1-independence-union`
**Source Lines**: 149-171
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "1. If something united with an other were what it is"
- Ends: "which is formed by it and another something."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about something as measure-relation: independent yet capable of union with another measure-relation. In union, each preserves itself through permanence of quantitative indifference, behaves as specifying moment of new measure-relation. Quality enveloped in quantitative element, indifferent towards exponent (external determinateness). Specific property not expressed in one measure-relation alone.

### Chunk 10: Series of exponents — comparative numbers, unit and amounts
**ID**: `rm-a-b-2-series-exponents`
**Source Lines**: 173-270
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "2. This combination with a plurality of others"
- Ends: "in the opposite series."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about combination with plurality yields different ratios with different exponents. Independent measure has exponent only in comparison with other measures; neutrality = real comparison. Independent measure displays qualitative exponent as series of different amounts (unit). Truly differentiates in characteristic series of exponents. Comparison requires unit common to both (ratio of exponents of series). Both sides are series: each number = unit with respect to opposite series, exponent for each member, comparative number for rest of its series.

### Chunk 11: Return to degree — exclusive unit, elective affinity
**ID**: `rm-a-b-3-return-degree-exclusive`
**Source Lines**: 271-323
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "3. In this relation there is a return to the mode"
- Ends: "no longer an indifferent connection but an elective affinity."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about return to quantum as degree (magnitude in quantum outside it, circle of quanta). In measure: externality = series of numerical ratios. Independent measure = self-externality. Self-reference = immediate relation, indifference only in quantum. Qualitative side falls in externality, relating to other = specific determination. Two measures specify themselves in third (exponent): each negatively posited, preserves itself, negation negated = qualitative unity = exclusive unit existing for itself. Exponents gain determinateness specifying reciprocally, difference = qualitative nature (but quantitative basis). Affinity = elective affinity.

### Chunk 12: Chemical and musical examples — exclusive affinities
**ID**: `rm-a-c-1-chemical-musical-examples`
**Source Lines**: 327-368
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "The expression elective affinity used here"
- Ends: "and belongs to particular parts of the concrete science of nature."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about elective affinity = chemical relation. Matter receives specific determinateness in connection with other, exists only as non-indifference. Connection bound up with quantity, with series of non-indifferent matters. Affinity with every member, each excludes every other. Not just chemical: single note depends on relation to other notes, harmony/disharmony = qualitative nature based on quantitative ratios forming series of exponents. Single note = keynote of system, also member in system of every other note. Harmonies = exclusive elective affinities, quality dissolves in quantitative progression. Principle of measure for affinities = question of higher order.

### Chunk 13: Quantitative vs qualitative — sudden conversion
**ID**: `rm-a-c-2-quantitative-qualitative-conversion`
**Source Lines**: 370-430
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED

**Text Boundaries**:
- Starts: "Inasmuch as the member of a series has its qualitative unity"
- Ends: "sometimes specific relations and measures."

**Analysis**: Complete logical thought about member of series: qualitative unity in relating to whole of opposite series. More specific determinateness = quantitative. Elective affinity = exclusive qualitative connection, escapes quantitative difference. Exclusion based on extensive magnitudes (intensity) = no exclusiveness posited, combination of any number possible. But combination = neutralization, exponent = determination of measure, exclusive. Numbers lose continuity, relating = more or less (negative character). Advantage of one exponent over another not confined to magnitude. Other side: matter of indifference whether receives neutralizing quantum from several opposite moments. Exclusive relating vulnerable to incursion of quantitative side. Sudden conversion: indifferent quantitative → qualitative, specifically determinate being → external relation, series of relations (quantitative and specific).

## Issues and Recommendations

### ✓ No Issues Found

The chunking appears to be:
- **Complete**: All substantive text covered
- **Coherent**: Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- **Properly Bounded**: Chunks don't leave gaps
- **Dialectically Sound**: Respects logical progression and transitions

### Potential Refinements (for future upgrades)

1. **Chunk boundaries** align with natural paragraph breaks and numbered sections (a., b., c., 1., 2., 3.), which is good for readability.

2. **Transitions** between chunks are clear and logical, following the dialectical development from immediate measures through combination, series, to elective affinity.

3. **Final chunk** (Quantitative vs qualitative conversion) appropriately represents the culmination of the relation of independent measures with the sudden conversion, transitioning to the next section.

4. **Chunk lengths** are appropriate, with chunk 10 being longer (98 lines) representing a complete logical development about series of exponents that is appropriately unified.

5. **Examples** (chemical and musical) are well-integrated into the logical flow, illustrating the elective affinity concept.

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. Create/verify `measures-topic-map.ts`
3. Verify chunks match source text exactly
4. Proceed to logical operation analysis
