# Source Analysis Summary: nodal-lines.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 136
- **Chunks Extracted**: 5
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `rm-b-1` | Exclusive measure continuity — separability, indifference | 3-33 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-b-2` | Self-reference as qualitative foundation — substrate | 35-44 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-b-3` | Self-repelling measure — nodal line | 46-66 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-b-4` | Qualitative leap — new quality, new something | 68-100 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `rm-b-5` | Gradualness vs leap — absolute interruption | 102-134 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in gradualness vs leap (transition to next section)

### Key Concepts
- **Exclusive measure**: Specific = exclusive, negative unity, separability
- **Self-reference**: Qualitative foundation, permanent material substrate
- **Self-repelling measure**: Nodal line of measures on scale of more and less
- **Qualitative leap**: New quality, new something, emerged from internal specifying unity
- **Gradualness vs leap**: Absolute interruption, transition as leap, wholly external

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (measureless.txt)
