# Source Analysis Summary: specific-quantum.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 189
- **Chunks Extracted**: 7
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `sq-a-1` | Measure as simple self-reference of quantum | 3-19 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-a-2` | Proposition: "Whatever is, has a measure" | 21-33 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-a-3` | Measure as standard — external vs original measure | 35-70 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-a-4` | Immediate measure — double determination and demise | 72-108 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-a-5` | The bald and the heap — quantitative to qualitative alteration | 110-140 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-a-6` | The cunning of the concept — quantum as indifferent limit | 142-167 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-a-7` | Specifying of measure — two sides | 169-187 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in specifying of measure (transition to next section)

### Key Concepts
- **Measure as self-reference**: Quantum becomes qualitative through self-reference
- **Universal proposition**: "Whatever is, has a measure" - fundamental principle
- **External vs original measure**: Standards are arbitrary/conventional, not natural
- **Double determination**: Quantum as both indifferent and qualitative
- **Quantitative to qualitative**: The transition illustrated by bald/heap examples
- **Cunning of concept**: Quantum attacks existence where quality seems absent
- **Specifying**: Measure sublates indifference, leading to next development

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (specifying-measure.txt, being-for-itself.txt)
