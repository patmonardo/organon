# Source Analysis Summary: specifying-measure.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 245
- **Chunks Extracted**: 8
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `sq-b-intro` | Specifying measure — three moments | 3-11 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-a-1` | The rule — unit determinate in itself | 15-30 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-b-1` | Specifying measure — determining external magnitude | 34-65 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-b-2` | Intensive/extensive vs specifying measure | 67-78 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-b-3` | Exponent as qualitative moment — power determination | 80-104 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-c-1` | Relation of two sides as qualities — indivisible unity | 108-141 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-c-2` | Variable magnitude — ratio of powers | 143-169 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `sq-b-c-3` | Genuine alteration — power determination, extensive vs intensive | 171-243 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in power determination (transition to next section)

### Key Concepts
- **Three moments**: Rule, specific quantity, relation as qualities
- **The rule**: External comparison, unit determinate in itself
- **Specifying measure**: Intensive measure, ratio and exponent
- **Exponent**: Qualitative moment, power determination
- **Relation as qualities**: Indivisible unity, double determination
- **Variable magnitude**: Ratio of powers, realized measure
- **Genuine alteration**: Power determination, extensive vs intensive
- **Mathematical examples**: s = at^2, s^3 = at^2 illustrating power determination

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (being-for-itself.txt)
