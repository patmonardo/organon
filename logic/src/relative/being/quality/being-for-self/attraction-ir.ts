First, it is in their being, and indeed their being-in-itself as contrasted with their reference to the other, that they should now have a firm point of support for their diversity as against their being negated; this in-itselfness rests on their being ones. But they all are this; in their being-in-itself, instead of having there their firm point of support for their diversity, they are all the same. Second, their existence and their way of relating to one another, that is, their positing themselves as one, is their reciprocal negating; this, however, is likewise one and the same determination of all through which they therefore posit themselves as identical; just as, by being in themselves the same, the ideality that should be posited in them through others is their own, and they thus repel just as little. According to their being and positing, they are, consequently, only one affirmative unity. They are and are only inasmuch as they negate themselves reciprocally and at the same time keep away this ideality, their being negated, from themselves, that is, they negate the reciprocal negating. But they are only inasmuch as they negate, and so, since their reciprocal negating is negated, their being is negated. They turn back upon themselves only by negating the others; they are only as this mediation, this turning back of theirs is their self-preservation and their being-for-itself. The ones themselves are each a one like any other. Repulsion is itself a referring; the one that excludes the ones refers itself to them, to the ones, that is, to itself. The negative relating of the ones to one another is consequently only a coming-together-with-oneself. This identity in which their repelling crosses over is the sublation of their diversity and externality which they should have rather asserted with respect to each other by excluding each other. This self-positing-in-a-one of the many ones is attraction.",

  "description": "Repulsion is the fragmentation of the one, first into the many of which it is the negative relating, since they presuppose each other as each existent; it is only the ought of ideality; this ideality will, however, be realized in attraction. Repulsion passes over into attraction, the many ones into one one. Both, repulsion and attraction, are at first distinguished from each other, repulsion as the reality of the ones, attraction as their posited ideality. Attraction refers to repulsion by having it for a presupposition. Repulsion delivers the material for attraction. If there were no ones, there would be nothing to attract; the representation of continuing attraction, of the consumption of the ones, presupposes an equally continuing generation of the ones. If attraction were represented as accomplished, that is, the many as brought to the point of the one one, the result would be just an inert one, no longer any attraction. The ideality immediately present in attraction still also has in it the determination of the negation of itself, the many ones to which it refers; attraction is inseparable from repulsion. Attraction is the positing of the given lack of distinction among the ones. Attraction is itself the positing in the first place of a one distinct from other ones; these are only the immediate ones that are to preserve themselves through repulsion; through their posited negation, however, what proceeds is the one of attraction which is therefore determined as the mediated one, the one posited as one. The one one is, however, ideality that has been realized, posited in the one; it attracts through the mediation of repulsion; it contains in itself this mediation as its determination. It thus does not swallow the attracted ones within it as into one point, that is, does not sublate them abstractly. Since it contains repulsion in its determination, the latter equally preserves the ones as many within it; by its attracting, it musters, so to speak, something before it, gains an area or a filling. Thus there is in it the unity of repulsion and attraction in general.",

  "description": "In the first place, that each presupposes itself, that in its presupposition each refers only to itself, this is already present in the way the still relative repulsion and attraction behave at first. Relative repulsion is the mutual repulsion of many ones which are already at hand, supposedly immediately given. But that there be many ones, this is repulsion itself; any presupposition that it would have is only its own positing. Moreover, the determination of the being that would accrue to the ones apart from their being posited (whereby they would already be) belongs likewise to repulsion. Repelling is that through which the ones manifest themselves and maintain themselves as ones; through which they are as such. Their being is their repulsion itself, which is thus not some relative existence against another other but relates itself throughout only to itself. Attraction is the positing of the one as such, of the real one, with respect to which the existence of the many is determined as only a vanishing idealization. Attraction thus directly presupposes itself; it presupposes itself in the determination namely, of the many ones to be an idealization, the same ones which are otherwise supposed to have existence for themselves and to repel others, including therefore any other that attracts. Against this determination of repulsion, the ones do not attain ideality only through the relation to attraction; on the contrary, the ideality is presupposed: it is the ideality of the ones as an existent in itself, inasmuch as they, as ones (including the one conceived as attracting), are not distinguished from one another but are one and the same. This self-presupposing of the two determinations, each for itself, implies further that each contains within itself the other as moment. Self-presupposing in general is the positing of oneself in a one as the negative of oneself (repulsion), and what is presupposed in this positing is the same as that which presupposes (attraction). That each is in itself only a moment, this is the transition of each from itself into the other, the negation of itself in the other and the positing of itself as the other of itself. The one, as such, is thus a coming-out-of-itself; is itself only the positing of itself as its other, as the many. And the many, for its part, is only the falling back upon itself and the positing of itself as its other, as a one, and is in this equally only the connecting of itself to itself, each continuing itself in its other. Therefore, the coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and the self-positing-as-one (attraction) are already inherently present as undivided. The repulsion of the determinedly existent ones is the self-preservation of the one through the mutual holding off of the others, so that (1) the other ones are negated in it (this is the side of its existence or of its being-for-another and is therefore attraction as the ideality of the ones); and (2) the one is in itself, without reference to the others (however, not only has the in-itself in general long since passed over into being-for-itself; the one in itself, according to its determination, is the coming to be of many). The attraction of the existent ones is their ideality and the positing of the one, and in this, as both the negating and the producing of the one, attraction sublates itself, and as a positing within it of the one, is the negative of itself: it is repulsion.",
