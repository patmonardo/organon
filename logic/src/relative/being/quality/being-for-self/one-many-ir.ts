It is indeterminate, yet no longer like being; its indeterminateness is the determinateness of self-reference, absolutely determined being; posited in-itselfness. As negation which, in accordance with its concept, is self-referring, it has distinction in it: it directs away from itself towards another, but this direction is immediately reversed, because, according to this moment of self-determining, there is no other to which it would be addressed, and the directing reverts back to itself. In this simple immediacy, even the mediation of existence and ideality, and with it all diversity and manifoldness, have vanished. In the one there is nothing; this nothing, the abstraction of self-reference, is here distinguished from the in-itselfness of the one; it is a posited nothing, for this in-itselfness no longer has the simplicity of the something, but, as mediation, has rather the determination of being concrete; taken in abstraction, it is indeed identical with the one, but different from its determination. So this nothing, posited as in the one, is the nothing as the void. The void is thus the quality of the one in its immediacy.",

  "description": "The one and the void constitute the first existence of being-for-itself. Each of these moments has negation for its determination, and is posited at the same time as an existence. The one and the void are each the reference of negation to negation as of an other to its other: the one is negation in the determination of being; the void, negation in the determination of non-being. Essentially, however, the one is only self-reference as referring negation, that is, it is itself the same as the void outside it is supposed to be. The one is consequently a becoming of many ones. Strictly speaking, however, this is not just a becoming; for becoming is a transition of being into nothing; the one, by contrast, becomes only a one. The one's own immanent reference is present; and, since this reference is negative and the one is at the same time an existent, the one repels itself from itself. This negative reference of the one to itself is repulsion. Repulsion is the positing of many ones through the one itself, the one's own coming-forth-from-itself, but to such outside it as are themselves only ones. The ones are presupposed with respect to each other through the repulsion of the one from itself; presupposed, posited as non-posited; their being-posited is sublated, they are existents referring only to themselves. Plurality appears not as otherness, but as a determination completely external to the one. The void is their limit, an external limit in which they are not supposed to be for one another. The void is determined as pure non-being, and this alone constitutes the limit of the ones. Repulsion is the making explicit of what the one is implicitly in itself; but, thus laid out as one-outside-the-other, infinity is here an infinity that has externalized itself.
