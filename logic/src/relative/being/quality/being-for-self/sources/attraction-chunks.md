# Chunking Plan for attraction.txt - C. REPULSION AND ATTRACTION

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Chunk the text into readable semantic units that preserve the movement of the source.
The TopicMap is a check that each unit is text-grounded and trackable.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining chunks through review.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**

- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: C. REPULSION AND ATTRACTION (392 lines)

- C. REPULSION AND ATTRACTION (lines 2-137)
  - a. Exclusion of the one (lines 4-137)
- b. The one one of attraction (lines 139-211)
- c. The connection of repulsion and attraction (lines 213-393)

**Note**: This plan follows C. REPULSION AND ATTRACTION as presented in the source text,
including its a., b., c. sub-sections as moments of the section.

**Workflow**:

```
Source Text → [Source Analysis] → Chunks + Topics → [Logical Op Generation] → Logical Operations

**TopicMap**: See `attraction-topic-map.ts` for the formal TopicMap structure that maps to:

- `TopicMapEntry.id` → `Chunk.id`
- `TopicMapEntry.title` → `Chunk.title` AND `LogicalOperation.label` (the "Title")
- `TopicMapEntry.lineRange` → Extract text → `Chunk.text`

The TopicMap keeps chunk IDs, titles, and line ranges aligned with the source text.

**Chunk Quality Check**:

- At a glance, the chunk should show a complete move in the text
- Meaning should be visible without reading every word
- If a line break blocks that, adjust boundaries

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: C. a. Exclusion of the one — mutual repulsion and self-preservation

**Lines**: 4-64
**Title**: C. a. Exclusion of the one — mutual repulsion and self-preservation
**Key Points**:

- Many ones are each a being
- Their existence or reference to one another is non-reference, external: abstract void
- They themselves are negative reference to themselves as existent others
- Demonstrated contradiction, infinity posited in immediacy of being
- Repulsion finds immediately before it that which is repelled
- Repulsion is excluding: one repels many not generated by it
- Repelling is mutual or from all sides, relative, limited by being of ones
- Plurality not at first posited otherness
- Limit is void, that in which ones are not, but in limit they also are
- Mutual repulsion is posited existence of many ones
- Not their being-for-itself, but their own distinguishing which preserves them
- They mutually negate themselves, posit one another as being only for-one
- They negate this being only for-one, repel ideality they have and are
- Moments which in ideality absolutely united come apart
- In plurality distinguished one has being
- Being-for-one determined in exclusion is being-for-other
- Each repelled by other, sublated, made into one not for itself but for-one
- Being-for-itself of many ones shows itself as self-preservation
- Through mediation of mutual repulsion in which they sublate themselves reciprocally
- Self-preservation consists in repelling ideality, positing ones as not being for-an-other
- Self-preservation through negative reference is rather their dissolution

### Chunk 2: C. a. Exclusion — ones maintaining themselves through reciprocal exclusion

**Lines**: 65-136
**Title**: C. a. Exclusion — ones maintaining themselves through reciprocal exclusion
**Key Points**:

- Ones not only are but maintain themselves through reciprocal exclusion
- In their being-in-itself as contrasted with reference to other
- Should have firm point of support for diversity as against being negated
- In-itselfness rests on their being ones, but they all are this
- In being-in-itself, instead of diversity, they are all same
- Their existence and way of relating is reciprocal negating
- This is one and same determination of all, positing themselves as identical
- By being in themselves same, ideality is their own, they repel just as little
- According to being and positing, only one affirmative unity
- Comparison: from either side show themselves as one and same, indistinguishable
- They are and are only inasmuch as they negate themselves reciprocally
- Keep away ideality, their being negated, negate reciprocal negating
- They are only inasmuch as they negate
- Since reciprocal negating is negated, their being is negated
- Negating rebounds off them, coming only by striking surface
- They turn back upon themselves only by negating others
- They are only as mediation, turning back is self-preservation and being-for-itself
- Since negating ineffectual because of resistance, they do not return, are not
- Ones themselves are each one like any other
- Repulsion is referring: one excluding ones refers itself to them, to itself
- Negative relating is only coming-together-with-oneself
- Identity in which repelling crosses over is sublation of diversity and externality
- Self-positing-in-a-one of many ones is attraction

### Chunk 3: b. The one one of attraction — ideality realized

**Lines**: 139-211
**Title**: b. The one one of attraction — ideality realized
**Key Points**:

- Repulsion is fragmentation of one into many
- Negative relating, since they presuppose each other as existent
- Only ought of ideality; ideality realized in attraction
- Repulsion passes over into attraction, many ones into one one
- Both distinguished: repulsion as reality, attraction as posited ideality
- Attraction refers to repulsion by having it for presupposition
- Repulsion delivers material for attraction
- If no ones, nothing to attract
- Representation of continuing attraction presupposes continuing generation
- Sense representation of spatial attraction gives continuity
- To replace atoms vanishing, another multitude comes from void
- If attraction accomplished, result inert one, no longer attraction
- Ideality in attraction has determination of negation of itself, many ones
- Attraction inseparable from repulsion
- To attract pertains to each of many ones equally
- None has advantage, equilibrium in attraction and repulsion
- Inert state of rest without ideality
- No immediately present one taking precedence
- Attraction is positing of given lack of distinction among ones
- Attraction is positing of one distinct from other ones
- Through posited negation, one of attraction proceeds
- Determined as mediated one, one posited as one
- First ones as immediate do not return into themselves in ideality
- Have ideality each in another
- One one is ideality realized, posited in one
- Attracts through mediation of repulsion
- Contains mediation as determination
- Does not swallow attracted ones abstractly
- Contains repulsion, preserves ones as many within it
- By attracting, musters something, gains area or filling
- Unity of repulsion and attraction in general

### Chunk 4: c. The connection of repulsion and attraction — inseparable unity

**Lines**: 213-302
**Title**: c. The connection of repulsion and attraction — inseparable unity
**Key Points**:

- Difference of one and many determined as difference of mutual reference
- Breaks down into two: repulsion and attraction
- Each stands at first outside other on its own
- Two essentially joined together nevertheless
- Still indeterminate unity must be brought out in greater detail
- Repulsion appears first as fundamental determination of one
- Appears as immediate, like ones generated by it
- Indifferent to attraction added externally as presupposed
- Attraction not presupposed by repulsion
- Not supposed to have part in positing and being of repulsion
- As if repulsion not already negation of itself
- Ones not already negated in it
- Repulsion in abstraction, by itself
- Attraction holds out to ones immediate existence as other
- Mere repulsion is dispersion of many ones in indeterminacy
- Outside sphere of repulsion itself
- Repulsion is negating of connection of many to one another
- Lack of connection is determination when abstractly taken
- Repulsion not just void
- Ones, although unconnected, do not repel what constitutes determination
- Although negative, repulsion essentially connection
- Mutual repulsion and flight not liberation
- Excluded still stands in connection with what excluded from it
- Moment of connection is attraction, within repulsion itself
- Negating of abstract repulsion by which ones would each be existent
- Referring only to itself without mutual exclusion
- Starting with repulsion as immediately present
- Attraction posited as intruding externally
- Two held apart as diverse determinations despite inseparability
- Not just repulsion presupposed by attraction
- Reverse connection: repulsion has attraction for presupposition
- As determined, inseparable
- Each determined as ought and limitation with respect to other
- Ought is abstract determinateness as existent in itself
- Directed beyond itself, refers to other
- Through mediation of other, each is as other
- Self-subsistence consists in being mutually posited in mediation
- Repulsion is positing of many; attraction positing of one
- Attraction negation of many; repulsion negation of ideality of many in one
- Attraction only through mediation of repulsion
- Repulsion only through mediation of attraction
- Mediation of each with itself through other is negated
- Each is its own self-mediation
- Closer examination brings back to unity of concept

### Chunk 5: c. Self-presupposing — each contains other as moment

**Lines**: 303-393
**Title**: c. Self-presupposing — each contains other as moment
**Key Points**:

- Each presupposes itself, refers only to itself
- Present in way relative repulsion and attraction behave at first
- Relative repulsion is mutual repulsion of many ones already at hand
- That there be many ones is repulsion itself
- Presupposition only its own positing
- Determination of being accruing to ones apart from positing belongs to repulsion
- Repelling is that through which ones manifest and maintain themselves
- Through which they are as such
- Their being is their repulsion itself
- Not relative existence against another other
- Relates itself throughout only to itself
- Attraction is positing of one as such, real one
- With respect to which existence of many determined as vanishing idealization
- Attraction directly presupposes itself
- Presupposes itself in determination of many ones to be idealization
- Same ones otherwise supposed to have existence, repel others
- Ideality not attained only through relation to attraction
- Ideality presupposed: ideality of ones as existent in itself
- As ones, not distinguished but one and same
- Self-presupposing implies each contains other as moment
- Self-presupposing is positing of oneself in one as negative of oneself (repulsion)
- Presupposed is same as that which presupposes (attraction)
- Each is in itself only moment
- Transition of each from itself into other
- Negation of itself in other, positing of itself as other of itself
- One is coming-out-of-itself
- Positing of itself as its other, as many
- Many is falling back upon itself
- Positing of itself as its other, as one
- Connecting of itself to itself, each continuing itself in its other
- Coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and self-positing-as-one (attraction) inherently present as undivided
- In relative repulsion and attraction, two are each negation of itself
- Continuity of itself in its other
- Repulsion of existent ones is self-preservation of one
- Through mutual holding off of others
- Other ones negated in it (attraction as ideality)
- One is in itself, without reference to others
- In-itself passed over into being-for-itself
- One in itself is coming to be of many
- Attraction of existent ones is their ideality and positing of one
- As both negating and producing of one, attraction sublates itself
- As positing within it of one, is negative of itself: repulsion
