    text: `A. BEING

Being, pure being, without further determination.
In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself
and also not unequal with respect to another;
it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly.
If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct,
or if it were posited by this determination or content
as distinct from an other,
it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity.
It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness.
There is nothing to be intuited in it,
if one can speak here of intuiting;
or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself.
Just as little is anything to be thought in it,
or, it is equally only this empty thinking.
Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing,
and neither more nor less than nothing.`,
