    text: `B. NOTHING

Nothing, pure nothingness;
it is simple equality with itself,
complete emptiness,
complete absence of determination and content;
lack of all distinction within.
In so far as mention can be made here of
intuiting and thinking,
it makes a difference whether something or nothing is
being intuited or thought.
To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning;
the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists)
in our intuiting or thinking;
or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself,
like pure being.
Nothing is therefore the same determination
or rather absence of determination,
and thus altogether the same as what pure being is.`,
    summary:
      'Pure nothingness = complete emptiness, absence of determination/content, no internal distinction; thinking/intuition of nothing is empty thinking/empty intuiting; nothing is altogether the same as pure being.'
