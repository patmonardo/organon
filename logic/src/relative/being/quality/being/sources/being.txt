SECTION I

Determinateness (Quality)

Being is the indeterminate immediate;
it is free of determinateness with respect to essence,
just as it is still free of any determinateness
that it can receive within itself.
This reflectionless being is being
as it immediately is only within.

Since it is immediate, it is being without quality;
but the character of indeterminateness attaches to it in itself
only in opposition to what is determinate or qualitative.
Determinate being thus comes to stand over and against being in general;
with that, however, the very indeterminateness of being
constitutes its quality.
It will therefore be shown that the first being is
in itself determinate, and therefore secondly,
that it passes over into existence, is existence;
that this latter, however, as finite being, sublates itself
and passes over into the infinite reference of being to itself;
it passes over, thirdly, into being-for-itself.

CHAPTER 1

Being

A. BEING

Being, pure being, without further determination.
In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself
and also not unequal with respect to another;
it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly.
If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct,
or if it were posited by this determination or content
as distinct from an other,
it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity.
It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness.
There is nothing to be intuited in it,
if one can speak here of intuiting;
or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself.
Just as little is anything to be thought in it,
or, it is equally only this empty thinking.
Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing,
and neither more nor less than nothing.
