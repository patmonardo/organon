## Overview

This is the third and final subspecies of C. INFINITY, developing the **true infinite** - the self-sublation of the bad infinite and finite in one process. The true infinite is the affirmative being that emerges from the negation of negation, the unity that embraces both itself and the finite. This completes the development of infinity and transitions to the next moment of the Logic.

## Structure

### Introduction (lines 4-18)
**Truth already present; need to take it up**: In reciprocal determination alternating back and forth, truth of finite and infinite already implicitly present. All needed is to take up what is there. Back and forth movement = external realization of concept. "Unity of finite and infinite" = uneven expression for unity as it is in truth.

### First immediate determination (lines 20-60)
- **Each contains the other**: In first immediate determination, infinite = transcending of finite, negation of finite. Finite = that which must be transcended, negation in it of itself, and this is infinite. In each, determinateness of other.
- **Two finites**: Taken without connecting reference: subsist independently. Infinite, thus positioned, is one of two; as only one, itself finite. **We have before us only two finites**.
- **Finitude of infinite; finite as self-subsistence**: Finitude of infinite lies in fact that separated from finite, placed on one side. Finite, removed from infinite, is self-reference (relativity, dependence, transitoriness removed). Same self-subsistence and self-affirmation which infinite presumed to be.

### Two pathways yield same result (lines 62-78)
- Two pathways: (1) Reference of infinite and finite to each other; (2) Complete separation. **Yield one and same result**.
- Each contains its other in own determination. When each taken for itself, each has other present in it as own moment.

### Scandalous unity; falsification (lines 80-138)
- **Scandalous unity**: Unity which is itself infinite that embraces both itself and finite. Since they must be distinguished, each within it itself unity of both. **There are thus two such unities**.
- **Falsification**: Common element posits them at first as negated (in unity lose qualitative nature). Important reflection: counter habit of representing infinite and finite in unity as still holding quality when taken apart. Seeing in unity nothing except contradiction, not resolution. Unity falsified.
- **Double unity falsified**: Infinite determined as such has finitude in it. In unity, infinite = in-itself; finite = limit in infinite. But such limit = absolute other, opposite. **Infinite = finitized infinite**. Finite has opposite in it, elevated above worth. **= infinitized finite**.

### Understanding's falsification; each is itself the unity (lines 140-183)
- **Understanding's falsification**: Holding reciprocal reference fixed as qualitative differentiation. Maintaining determination separate, absolutely separate. Comes from forgetting concept of these moments.
- **Each is itself the unity**: According to concept, unity not external bringing together. **Rather, each is itself this unity**. This only as sublating of itself (neither has advantage). Finitude only as transcending of itself; within it infinite contained. Infinite only as transcending of finite; contains its other essentially. **Finite not sublated by infinite as power outside it; its infinity consists in sublating itself**.
- **Sublating is negation of negation**: That into which finite sublated = infinite as negating of finitude. But latter = existence, determined as non-being. **It is only negation that in negation sublates itself**.

### Negation of negation = self-reference, affirmation (lines 185-209)
- **Present in both**: Same negation of negation. **Negation of negation in itself = self-reference, affirmation** (turning back to itself, through mediation).
- **In infinite progression**: Both negated and posited as distinct. Also posited is connectedness of terms. Need to see what is in fact present.

### Infinite progression: connection; both return to themselves (lines 211-255)
- **Twofold sublation**: Can be taken as simple, mutual externality. But connection also present. Finite comes first; transcending; beyond = infinite; third: negation transcended, new limit, finite again. **Complete, self-closing movement. Finite restored; rejoined itself, in beyond only found itself again**.
- **Infinite also returns**: In infinite, new limit arises. **Infinite not advanced one jot further; arrived at itself**.
- **Both are movement**: Finite and infinite both = movement of each returning to itself through its negation. Only as implicit mediation. Affirmative of each contains negative of each = negation of negation. **They are result**. Not in determination they had at beginning.

### Error of one-sidedness; double meaning; true infinite (lines 284-333)
- **Error**: Finite and infinite each taken as starting point; two results. **Matter of total indifference which taken as starting point**.
- **Double meaning**: Since both moments of progress, they are jointly finite. Since equally jointly negated, result as negation of their joint finitude = infinite. Their distinction = double meaning.
  - Finite: (1) finite over against infinite; (2) finite and infinite over against infinite.
  - Infinite: (1) one of two moments (bad infinite); (2) infinite in which two moments only moments.
- **True infinite**: Nature of infinite = process in which lowers itself to be only one of its determinations over against finite (therefore one of finites) and elevates this distinction and itself to be self-affirmation. **Through this mediation = true infinite**.

### True infinite as becoming; as being (lines 335-382)
- **As becoming**: Determination of true infinite cannot be captured in formula of unity. Unity = abstract, motionless. **But infinite essentially only as becoming**. Becoming: being/nothing → existence/something/other → finite/infinite (these two themselves as in becoming).
- **As being**: Infinite as being-turned-back-unto-itself = being (not indeterminate, abstract; posited as negating negation). Consequently also existence or "thereness" (contains negation, determinateness). **It is, and is there, present, before us**.
- **Bad infinite = beyond**: Only negation of finite posited as real, abstract first negation. Ought not be there, unattainable. **Untrue = unattainable; such infinite = untrue**.
- **Circle vs straight line**: Image of progression in infinity = straight line (infinite only at limits, where existence is not). **As true infinite, bent back upon itself, image = circle** (line that has reached itself, closed and wholly present, without beginning and end).

### True infinity as reality; ideality (lines 384-427)
- **Reality**: True infinity as existence posited as affirmative = reality in higher sense. Has concrete content. **Not finite which is real, but infinite**. Reality further determined as essence, concept, idea, etc.
- **Ideality**: Negation (against which reality is affirmative) = negation of negation. Negation determined as ideality. **Idealized = finite as it is in true infinite** (determination, content, distinct but not subsistent existent, moment). Ideality has more concrete signification.
- **Opposition**: As regards reality and ideality, opposition grasped so finite = "the real," infinite = "the idealized". When contrasted this way: back to one-sidedness of bad infinite, still fixed in affirmative existence of finite.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Truth Already Present**: In reciprocal determination alternating, truth already implicitly present. All needed is to take it up.

2. **Two Finites**: Taken without connecting reference: infinite, thus positioned, is one of two; as only one, itself finite. **We have before us only two finites**.

3. **Scandalous Unity**: Unity which is itself infinite that embraces both itself and finite. Each within it itself unity of both. **There are thus two such unities**.

4. **Finitized Infinite and Infinitized Finite**: Understanding's falsification produces finitized infinite and infinitized finite.

5. **Each Is Itself the Unity**: According to concept, each is itself this unity (as sublating of itself). **Finite not sublated by infinite as power outside it; its infinity consists in sublating itself**.

6. **Negation of Negation**: It is only negation that in negation sublates itself. **Negation of negation in itself = self-reference, affirmation**.

7. **Both Return to Themselves**: Finite and infinite both = movement of each returning to itself through its negation. **They are result**.

8. **Double Meaning**: Their distinction = double meaning. Finite: finite over against infinite; finite and infinite over against infinite. Infinite: bad infinite; true infinite (in which two moments only moments).

9. **True Infinite**: Process in which lowers itself to be one of finites and elevates this distinction to self-affirmation. **Through this mediation = true infinite**.

10. **Circle vs Straight Line**: Bad infinite = straight line (infinite only at limits). **True infinite = circle** (closed and wholly present, without beginning and end).

11. **Reality and Ideality**: Not finite which is real, but infinite. Negation determined as ideality. **Idealized = finite as it is in true infinite** (moment, not subsistent existent).

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Truth Present** (need to take it up)
2. **Two Finites** (each contains other)
3. **Scandalous Unity** (two unities)
4. **Each Is Itself the Unity** (sublating of itself)
5. **Negation of Negation** (self-reference, affirmation)
6. **Both Return to Themselves** (result)
7. **True Infinite** (process, becoming, being)
8. **Reality and Ideality** (infinite real, finite idealized)

## Transition Points

- **Alternating → Unity**: Truth already present; need to take it up
- **Two Finites → Unity**: Each contains other; two pathways yield same result
- **Unity → Each Is Itself**: Understanding's falsification; each is itself the unity
- **Sublating → Negation of Negation**: Only negation that in negation sublates itself
- **Progression → Return**: Both return to themselves; result
- **Result → True Infinite**: Double meaning; true infinite as process
- **True Infinite → Reality**: Circle vs straight line; reality and ideality

## Related Concepts

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: truth present → two finites → unity → each is itself → negation of negation → return → true infinite
- The "scandalous unity" and "two finites" are key insights
- The "circle vs straight line" is a powerful image
- The "reality and ideality" distinction is important for understanding the true infinite
- This completes the development of infinity and transitions to the next moment
