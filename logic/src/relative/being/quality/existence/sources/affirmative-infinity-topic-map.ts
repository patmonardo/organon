 * TopicMap for affirmative-infinity.txt - C. INFINITY (c) Affirmative infinity
 *
 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the true infinite - the self-sublation
 * of the bad infinite and finite in one process. The true infinite is the affirmative being
 * that emerges from the negation of negation, the unity that embraces both itself and the finite.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - Introduction: Truth already present; need to take it up; unity uneven expression
 * - First immediate determination: Each contains the other; two finites
 * - Two pathways yield same result
 * - Scandalous unity; two unities; falsification
 * - Understanding's falsification; each is itself the unity
 * - Negation of negation = self-reference, affirmation
 * - Infinite progression: both negated and posited; connection
 * - Both are movement returning to itself; result
 * - True infinite as becoming; as being (circle vs straight line)
 * - True infinity as reality; ideality

This back and forth movement constitutes the external realization of the concept in which the content of the latter is posited, but externally, as a falling out of the two; all that is needed is the comparing of these two different moments in which the unity is given which the concept itself gives. \"Unity of the finite and the infinite\" (as has often been already noted but must especially be kept in mind at this juncture) is the uneven expression for the unity as it is in truth; but also the removal of this uneven determination must be found in the externalization of the concept that lies ahead of us.",

In each, therefore, there is the determinateness of the other, whereas, according to the viewpoint of the infinite progression, the two should be mutually excluded and would have to follow one another only alternately; neither can be posited and grasped without the other, the infinite without the finite, the finite without the infinite. In saying what the infinite is, namely the negation of the finite, the finite itself is said also; it cannot be avoided in the determination of the infinite. One need only know what is being said in order to find the determination of the finite in the infinite. Regarding the finite, it is readily conceded that it is the null; this very nothingness is however the infinite from which it is inseparable. Understood in this way, they may seem to be taken according to the way each refers to its other. Taken without this connecting reference, and thus joined only through an \"and,\" they subsist independently, each only an existent over against the other. We have to examine how they would be constituted in this way. The infinite, thus positioned, is one of the two; but, as only one of them, it is itself finite, it is not the whole but only one side; it has its limit in that which stands over against it; and so it is the finite infinite.

But such a limit is the absolute other of the infinite, its opposite. The infinite's determination, which is the in-itself as such, is corrupted by being saddled with a quality of this sort; the infinite is thus a finitized infinite. Likewise, since the finite is as such only the non-in-itself but equally has its opposite in it by virtue of the said unity, it is elevated above its worth and, so to speak, infinitely elevated; it is posited as the infinitized finite. Likewise, just as the simple unity of infinite and finite was falsified before by the understanding, so too is the double unity. Here also this happens because the infinite is taken in one of the two unities not as negated but, rather, as the in-itself in which, therefore, determinateness and restriction should not be posited, for they would debase and corrupt it. Conversely, the finite is equally held fixed as not negated, although null in itself; so that, in combination with the infinite, it is elevated to what it is not and is thereby infinitized notwithstanding its determination that has not vanished but is rather perpetuated.",

According to this concept, the unity of the finite and the infinite is not an external bringing together of them, nor an incongruous combination that goes against their nature, one in which inherently separate and opposed terms that exist independently and are consequently incompatible, would be knotted together. Rather, each is itself this unity, and this only as a sublating of itself in which neither would have an advantage over the other in in-itselfness and affirmative existence. As has earlier been shown, finitude is only as a transcending of itself; it is therefore within it that the infinite, the other of itself, is contained. Similarly, the infinite is only as the transcending of the finite; it therefore contains its other essentially, and it is thus within it that it is the other of itself.

But it is a matter of total indifference which is taken as the starting point and, with this, the distinction caused by the duality of results dissolves of itself. This is likewise posited in the line of the infinite progression, open-ended on both sides, wherein each of the moments recurs in equal alternation, and it is totally extraneous at which position the progression is arrested and taken as beginning. The moments are distinguished in the progression but each is equally only moment of the other. Since both, the finite and the infinite, are themselves moments of the progress, they are jointly the finite, and, since they are equally jointly negated in it and in the result, this result as the negation of their joint finitude is called with truth the infinite. Their distinction is thus the double meaning which they both have. The finite has the double meaning, first, of being the finite over against the infinite which stands over against it, and, second, of being at the same time the finite and the infinite over against the infinite. Also the infinite has the double meaning of being one of the two moments (it is then the bad infinite) and of being the infinite in which the two moments, itself and its other, are only moments. Therefore, as in fact we now have it, the nature of the infinite is that it is the process in which it lowers itself to be only one of its determinations over against the finite and therefore itself only one of the finites, and elevates this distinction of itself and itself to be self-affirmation and, through this mediation, the true infinite.",

    description: "This infinite, as being-turned-back-unto-itself, as reference of itself to itself, is being; but not indeterminate, abstract being, for it is posited as negating the negation; consequently, it is also existence or \"thereness,\" for it contains negation in general and consequently determinateness. It is, and is there, present, before us. Only the bad infinite is the beyond, since it is only the negation of the finite posited as real and, as such, it is abstract first negation; thus determined only as negative, it does not have the affirmation of existence in it; held fast only as something negative, it ought not to be there, it ought to be unattainable. However, to be thus unattainable is not its grandeur but rather its defect, which is at bottom the result of holding fast to the finite as such, as existent. It is the untrue which is the unattainable, and what must be recognized is that such an infinite is the untrue. The image of the progression in infinity is the straight line; the infinite is only at the two limits of this line, and always only is where the latter (which is existence) is not but transcends itself, in its non-existence, that is, in the indeterminate. As true infinite, bent back upon itself, its image becomes the circle, the line that has reached itself, closed and wholly present, without beginning and end.",

    description: "True infinity, thus taken in general as existence posited as affirmative in contrast to abstract negation, is reality in a higher sense than it was earlier as simply determined; it has now obtained a concrete content. It is not the finite which is the real, but rather the infinite. Thus reality is further determined as essence, concept, idea, and so forth. In connection with the more concrete, it is however superfluous to repeat such earlier and more abstract categories as reality, and to use them for determinations more concrete than they are by themselves. Such a repetition, as when it is said that essence, or that the concept, is real, has its origin in the fact that to uneducated thought the most abstract categories such as being, existence, reality, finitude, are the most familiar. The more immediate occasion, however, for recalling here the categories of reality is that the negation, against which reality is the affirmative, is here the negation of negation, and consequently itself posited over against that reality which finite existence is. Negation is thus determined as ideality; the idealized is the finite as it is in the true infinite (as a determination, a content, a distinct but not a subsistent existent, a moment rather. Ideality has this more concrete signification which is not fully expressed through the negation of finite existence.) As regards reality and ideality, the opposition of finite and infinite is, however, so grasped that the finite assumes the value of \"the real,\" whereas the infinite that of \"the idealized\"; in the same way, further on, also the concept is regarded as an idealization, that is, as a mere idealization, in contrast to existence in general, which is regarded as \"the real.\" When contrasted in this way, it is of course of no use to have reserved for the said concrete determination of negation the distinctive expression of \"idealization\"; in that opposition of finite and infinite, we are back to the one-sidedness of the abstract negative characteristic of the bad infinite and still fixed in the affirmative existence of the finite.",
