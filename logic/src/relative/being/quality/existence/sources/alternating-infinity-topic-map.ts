 * TopicMap for alternating-infinity.txt - C. INFINITY (b) Alternating determination of finite and infinite
 *
 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the "bad infinite" - the infinite
 * of the understanding that alternates with the finite in an endless progression.
 * The unity of finite and infinite is present but hidden, driving the alternation.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - Introduction: Infinite falls back into category of something; finite resurrected
 * - Further determination: finite and infinite as others; bad infinite
 * - Contradiction: two determinacies, two worlds; develops into explicit forms
 * - Unity appears as transition; process of transition
 * - Alternating determination; progress to infinity
 * - Abstract transcending incomplete; unity not reflected upon

And so, as existent and at the same time as the non-being of an other, it has fallen back into the category of the something, of something determinate in general. More precisely: the infinite is the existence reflected into itself which results from the mediating sublation of determinateness in general and is consequently posited as existence distinct from its determinateness; therefore, it has fallen back into the category of something with a limit. In accordance with this determinateness, the finite stands over against the infinite as real existence; they thus remain outside each other, standing in qualitative mutual reference; the immediate being of the infinite resurrects the being of its negation, of the finite again, which seemed at first to have vanished into the infinite.",

When, therefore, the understanding, elevating itself above this finite world, rises to what is the highest for it, to the infinite, the finite world remains for it as something on this side here, and, thus posited only above the finite, the infinite is separated from the finite and, for the same reason, the finite from the infinite: each is placed in a different location, the finite as existence here, and the infinite, although the being-in-itself of the finite, there as a beyond, at a nebulous, inaccessible distance outside which there stands, enduring, the finite.",

But the limit is the first negation; both are thus limited, finite, in themselves. Yet, as each affirmatively refers itself to itself, each is also the negation of its limit; each thus immediately repels the negation from itself as its non-being, and, qualitatively severed from it, posits it as an other being outside it: the finite posits its non-being as this infinite, and the infinite likewise the finite.",

But it has been shown that the infinite itself attains affirmative being only by the mediation of negation, as negation of negation, and that when its affirmation thus attained is taken as just simple, qualitative being, the negation contained in it is demoted to simple immediate negation and, therefore, to determinateness and limit; and these, then, are excluded from the infinite as contradicting its in-itself; they are posited as not belonging to it but rather as opposed to its in-itself, as the finite. Since each is in it and through its determination the positing of its other, the two are inseparable.
