## Overview

This is the first subspecies of C. INFINITY, establishing the infinite as **negation of negation**, the **affirmative**, and showing how the finite transcends itself to become infinite. This sets up the development through alternating infinity to affirmative infinity.

## Structure

### Introduction (lines 4-44)

#### Infinite as definition of absolute; not free from restrictedness (lines 4-24)
- Infinite in simple concept = fresh definition of absolute
- Self-reference devoid of determination; posited as being and becoming
- Forms of existence have no place in definitions of absolute (only determinacies, finite)
- Infinite accepted unqualifiedly as absolute (explicitly determined as negation of finite)
- Restrictedness explicitly referred to and denied
- **But by just this negation, infinite not already free from restrictedness and finitude**

#### True vs bad infinity; outline (lines 25-44)
- Essential to distinguish **true concept of infinity from bad infinity**
- Infinite of reason vs infinite of understanding
- **Bad infinite = finitized infinite**
- Wanting to maintain infinite pure and distant from finite: by that very fact only made finite
- Outline:
  - (a) In simple determination: affirmative as negation of finite
  - (b) But thereby in alternating determination with infinite; abstract, one-sided infinite
  - (c) Self-sublation of this infinite and finite in one process = **true infinite**

### a. The infinite in general (lines 46-92)

#### Negation of negation; spirit at home (lines 48-58)
- Infinite = negation of negation, affirmative
- Being that has reinstated itself out of restrictedness
- In more intense sense than first immediate being
- **True being; elevation above restriction**
- At mention of infinite, soul and spirit light up
- In infinite, spirit at home (not only abstractly)
- Rises to itself, to light of thinking, universality, freedom

#### Finite transcends itself to become infinite (lines 59-65)
- First given with concept of infinite: in being-in-itself existence determined as finite and transcends restriction
- **Very nature of finite: transcend itself, negate its negation, become infinite**

#### Not external elevation; finite's own nature (lines 66-84)
- Infinite does not stand above finite as ready-made (finite fixed outside/below)
- Not we only (subjective reason) who transcend finite into infinite
- Not external elevation (remains external to finite, doesn't affect it)
- **Finite itself being elevated to infinity**
- Not alien force; rather its nature to refer itself to itself as restriction (restriction as such and as ought)
- Transcend restriction; or rather, in self-reference, have negated restriction and gone above/beyond
- Not in sublation of finite in general that infinity comes to be
- **Finite is just this: through its nature comes to be itself the infinite**
- Infinity = affirmative determination, vocation, what it truly is in itself

#### Finite vanishes into infinite (lines 85-92)
- **Finite has vanished into infinite**
- **What is, is only the infinite**

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Infinite as Definition of Absolute**: Fresh definition; self-reference devoid of determination. But by negation of finite, not already free from restrictedness.

2. **True vs Bad Infinity**: Essential distinction. Bad infinite = finitized infinite. Wanting to maintain infinite pure and distant from finite: by that very fact only made finite.

3. **True Infinite**: Self-sublation of bad infinite and finite in one process.

4. **Infinite as Negation of Negation**: Affirmative; being reinstated out of restrictedness. True being; elevation above restriction.

5. **Spirit at Home**: In infinite, spirit at home (not only abstractly). Rises to itself, to light of thinking, universality, freedom.

6. **Finite's Nature**: Very nature of finite: transcend itself, negate its negation, become infinite. Through its nature comes to be itself the infinite.

7. **Not External Elevation**: Not we who transcend; not external elevation. Finite itself being elevated; its own nature.

8. **Finite Vanishes**: Finite has vanished into infinite. What is, is only the infinite.

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Infinite as Definition** (absolute, but not free from restrictedness)
2. **True vs Bad Infinity** (distinction; outline)
3. **Infinite in General** (negation of negation; finite transcends itself)
4. **Finite Vanishes** (what is, is only the infinite)

## Transition Points

- **Finite → Infinite**: Finite transcends itself, negates its negation, becomes infinite
- **Not External**: Not we who transcend; finite's own nature
- **Vanishing**: Finite vanishes into infinite

## Related Concepts

- **Finite**: That which transcends itself to become infinite
- **Restriction**: What finite transcends
- **Ought**: The moment of finite (restriction as such and as ought)
- **Bad Infinite**: Finitized infinite (to be developed in alternating infinity)
- **True Infinite**: Self-sublation of bad infinite and finite (to be developed in affirmative infinity)

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: definition → distinction → development → vanishing
- The distinction between true and bad infinity is critical
- The insight that finite's nature is to become infinite is fundamental
- The vanishing of finite into infinite sets up the next subspecies
