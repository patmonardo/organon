 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the infinite as negation of negation,
 * the affirmative, showing how the finite transcends itself to become infinite.

 * Structure:
 * - Introduction: Infinite as definition of absolute; true vs bad infinity; outline
 * - a. The infinite in general:
 *   - Infinite as negation of negation; spirit at home
 *   - Finite transcends itself to become infinite; not external elevation
 *   - Finite vanishes into infinite

    description: "The infinite in its simple concept can be regarded, first of all, as a fresh definition of the absolute; as self-reference devoid of determination, it is posited as being and becoming. The forms of existence have no place in the series of determinations that can be regarded as definitions of the absolute, since the forms of that sphere are immediately posited for themselves only as determinacies, as finite in general. But the infinite is accepted unqualifiedly as absolute, since it is explicitly determined as the negation of the finite; the restrictedness (to which being and becoming would somehow be susceptible even if they do not have it or exhibit it) is thereby both explicitly referred to and denied in it. But, in fact, by just this negation the infinite is not already free from restrictedness and finitude.",

The latter is in fact a finitized infinite, and, as we shall now discover, in wanting to maintain the infinite pure and distant from the finite, the infinite is by that very fact only made finite. The infinite (a) in simple determination, is the affirmative as negation of the finite; (b) but is thereby in alternating determination with the infinite, and is abstract, one-sided infinite; (c) is the self-sublation of this infinite and of the finite in one process.

In so far as the finite itself is being elevated to infinity, it is not at all an alien force that does this for it; it is rather its nature to refer itself to itself as restriction (both restriction as such and as ought) and to transcend this restriction, or rather, in this self-reference, to have negated the restriction and gone above and beyond it. It is not in the sublation of the finite in general that infinity in general comes to be, but the finite is rather just this, that through its nature it comes to be itself the infinite.
