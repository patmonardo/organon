The moments of being-for-itself have sunk into an indifferentiation which is immediacy or being, but an immediacy that is based on the negating posited as its determination. Being-for-itself is thus an existent-for-itself, and, since in this immediacy its inner meaning vanishes, it is the totally abstract limit of itself: the one. Attention may be drawn in advance to the difficulties that lie ahead in the exposition of the development of the one, and to the source of these difficulties. The moments that constitute the concept of the one as being-for-itself occur in it one outside the other: (1) negation in general; (2) two negations that are, therefore, (3) the same, (4) absolutely opposed; (5) self-reference, identity as such; (6) negative reference which is nonetheless self-reference.

inasmuch as the being-for-itself is fixed as the one,\nas existent for itself, as immediately present,\nits negative reference to itself is\nat the same time reference to an existent;\nand since the

repulsion\nthat exists in itself determines itself\nas the second, the external repulsion.\n\nWe must first establish the determinations\nthat the many ones have as such.\nThe becoming of the many, or their being produced,\nimmediately vanishes as the product of a positing;\nwhat is produced are the ones, not for another,\nbut as infinitely referring to themselves.\nThe one repels only itself from itself;\nit does not come to be but it already is;\nthat which is represented as the repelled is\nequally a one, an existent;\nrepelling and being repelled applies\nin like manner to both, and makes no difference.\n\nThe ones are thus presupposed\nwith respect to each other posited through\nthe repulsion of the one from itself;\npresupposed, posited as non-posited;\ntheir being-posited is sublated,\nthey are existents with respect to each other,\nsuch as refer only to themselves.\n\nThus plurality appears not as an otherness,\nbut as a determination completely external to the one.\nThe

being-for-other affirmatively in them.\nTheir connecting reference\n(and this they have through their unity which is in itself),\nas posited here, is determined as none;\nit is again the previously posited void.\nThis void is their limit,\nbut an external limit in which\nthey are not supposed to be for one another.\nThe limit is that in which\nthe limited are just as much as are not;\nbut the void is determined as pure non-being,\nand this alone constitutes the limit of the ones.\n\nThe repulsion of the one from itself is\nthe making explicit of what\nthe one is implicitly in itself;\nbut,

Both, repulsion and attraction, are at first distinguished from each other, repulsion as the reality of the ones, attraction as their posited ideality. Attraction refers to repulsion by having it for a presupposition. Repulsion delivers the material for attraction. If there were no ones, there would be nothing to attract; the representation of continuing attraction, of the consumption of the ones, presupposes an equally continuing generation of the ones. If attraction were represented as accomplished, that is, the many as brought to the point of the one one, the result would be just an inert one, no longer any attraction. The ideality immediately present in attraction still also has in it the determination of the negation of itself, the many ones to which it refers; attraction is inseparable from repulsion. Attraction is the positing of the given lack of distinction among the ones. Attraction is itself the positing in the first place of a one distinct from other ones; these are only the immediate ones that are to preserve themselves through repulsion; through their posited negation, however, what proceeds is the one of attraction which is therefore determined as the mediated one, the one posited as one.

Their still indeterminate unity must be brought out in greater detail. As the fundamental determination of the one, repulsion appears first, and it appears as immediate, like its ones which are indeed generated by it and yet are at the same time posited as immediate, and it is therefore indifferent to the attraction which is added to it externally as thus presupposed. Rather, attraction is not presupposed by repulsion: it is not supposed to have any part in the positing and in the being of the latter, that is, as if repulsion were not, already in it, the negation of itself, or the ones were not already negated in it. In this way, we have repulsion in abstraction, by itself, and attraction likewise holds out to the ones, as each an existent, the side of an immediate existence which comes to them by itself as an other. Mere repulsion is the dispersion of the many ones in indeterminacy, outside the sphere of repulsion itself; for repulsion is the negating of the connection of the many to one another; lack of connection is their determination when abstractly taken. But repulsion is not just the void; the ones, although unconnected, do not repel what constitutes their determination, do not exclude it. Although negative, repulsion is nonetheless essentially connection; the mutual repulsion and flight is not a liberation from what is repelled and fled from; that which is excluded still stands in connection with what is excluded from it. But this moment of connection is attraction, which is thus within repulsion itself; it is the negating of that abstract repulsion by which the ones would each be an existent referring only to itself without mutual exclusion. As thus determined, they are inseparable, and at the same time each is determined as an ought and a limitation with respect to the other. Repulsion is the positing of the many; attraction the positing of the one; this latter is equally the negation of the many and the former the negation of the ideality of such a many in the one; so that attraction too is attraction only through the mediation of repulsion, just as repulsion is repulsion through the mediation of attraction. In all this, however, the mediation of each with itself through the other is in fact negated; each of the two determinations is its own self-mediation.'

SET c.description = 'In the first place, that each presupposes itself, that in its presupposition each refers only to itself, this is already present in the way the still relative repulsion and attraction behave at first. Relative repulsion is the mutual repulsion of many ones which are already at hand, supposedly immediately given. But that there be many ones, this is repulsion itself; any presupposition that it would have is only its own positing. Moreover, the determination of the being that would accrue to the ones apart from their being posited (whereby they would already be) belongs likewise to repulsion. Repelling is that through which the ones manifest themselves and maintain themselves as ones; through which they are as such. Their being is their repulsion itself, which is thus not some relative existence against another other but relates itself throughout only to itself. Attraction is the positing of the one as such, of the real one, with respect to which the existence of the many is determined as only a vanishing idealization. Attraction thus directly presupposes itself; it presupposes itself in the determination namely, of the many ones to be an idealization, the same ones which are otherwise supposed to have existence for themselves and to repel others, including therefore any other that attracts. Against this determination of repulsion, the ones do not attain ideality only through the relation to attraction; on the contrary, the ideality is presupposed: it is the ideality of the ones as an existent in itself, inasmuch as they, as ones (including the one conceived as attracting), are not distinguished from one another but are one and the same. This self-presupposing of the two determinations, each for itself, implies further that each contains within itself the other as moment. Self-presupposing in general is the positing of oneself in a one as the negative of oneself (repulsion), and what is presupposed in this positing is the same as that which presupposes (attraction). That each is in itself only a moment, this is the transition of each from itself into the other, the negation of itself in the other and the positing of itself as the other of itself. The one, as such, is thus a coming-out-of-itself; is itself only the positing of itself as its other, as the many. And the many, for its part, is only the falling back upon itself and the positing of itself as its other, as a one, and is in this equally only the connecting of itself to itself, each continuing itself in its other. Therefore, the coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and the self-positing-as-one (attraction) are already inherently present as undivided. The repulsion of the determinedly existent ones is the self-preservation of the one through the mutual holding off of the others, so that (1) the other ones are negated in it (this is the side of its existence or of its being-for-another and is therefore attraction as the ideality of the ones); and (2) the one is in itself, without reference to the others (however, not only has the in-itself in general long since passed over into being-for-itself; the one in itself, according to its determination, is the coming to be of many). The attraction of the existent ones is their ideality and the positing of the one, and in this, as both the negating and the producing of the one, attraction sublates itself, and as a positing within it of the one, is the negative of itself: it is repulsion.'
