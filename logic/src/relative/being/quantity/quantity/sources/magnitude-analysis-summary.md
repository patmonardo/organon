# Source Analysis Summary: continuous-discrete-magnitude.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 59
- **Chunks Extracted**: 3
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `quantity-continuous-discrete-intro` | Continuous and Discrete Magnitude: two moments of quantity | 3-23 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantity-continuous-magnitude` | Continuous Magnitude: immediate quantity | 25-32 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `quantity-discrete-magnitude` | Discrete Magnitude: outsideness-of-one-another as discontinuous | 34-57 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Section structure (1, 2) properly respected

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Follows Hegel's structural divisions (section 1, section 2)
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in discrete magnitude as many ones of unity

### Key Concepts
- **Two moments of quantity**: Quantity contains continuity and discreteness, posited at first as continuity (continuous magnitude), continuity is compact unity holding discrete together
- **Continuous Magnitude**: Immediate quantity is continuous magnitude, but quantity is not immediate (immediacy is sublated), quantity must be posited in immanent determinateness (the one)
- **Discrete Magnitude**: Moment and whole of quantity, outsideness-of-one-another as discontinuous/broken off, but discreteness is itself continuous (ones are same, have same unity), discrete magnitude is many ones of a unity (not many ones in general)

### Structural Analysis
- **Section 1**: Development of quantity as containing two moments, posited as continuity (continuous magnitude)
- **Section 2**: Immediate quantity as continuous magnitude, but quantity must be posited in one (discrete magnitude), discrete magnitude as many ones of unity

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Structure properly respects Hegel's divisions
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (limiting-quantity.txt)
