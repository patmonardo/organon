# Source Analysis Summary: number.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 137
- **Chunks Extracted**: 4
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `number-quantum-as-number` | Quantum as number: complete positedness | 4-52 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `number-amount-and-unit` | Amount and unit: the two moments of number | 53-65 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `number-amount-in-limit` | Amount in the limit: many ones present | 67-109 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `number-indifference-and-exteriority` | Number's indifference and exteriority | 111-136 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in intrinsic contradiction (quality of quantum)

### Key Concepts
- **Quantum as number**: Complete positedness, limit as plurality distinguished from unity, discrete magnitude with continuity, one as principle (self-referring, enclosing, other-excluding)
- **Amount and unit**: Two moments of number, limit as manifold containing many ones, amount as how many times, unit as continuity of amount
- **Amount in limit**: Many ones present (not sublated), all equal (each is the hundredth), many constitute delimitation itself, number is the delimitation
- **Number's indifference/exteriority**: Distinguishing remains quantitative, absolutely determined with simple immediacy, reference to other external, yet absolute exteriority in the one itself, intrinsic contradiction is quality of quantum

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (quantum.txt or infinity.txt)
