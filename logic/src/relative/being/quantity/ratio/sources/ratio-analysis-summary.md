# Source Analysis Summary: ratio.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 192
- **Chunks Extracted**: 7
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text (excluding transitional remark at lines 76-81)
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `ratio-intro-qualitative-moment` | Ratio: quantum qualitatively determined | 6-50 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `ratio-direct-intro` | Direct ratio: qualitative moment not yet explicit | 52-74 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `ratio-direct-exponent` | Exponent: one determinateness of both quanta | 85-90 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `ratio-direct-exponent-qualitative` | Exponent as qualitatively determined quantum | 92-106 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `ratio-direct-exponent-meaning` | Exponent: meaning of both determinations | 108-132 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `ratio-direct-incompleteness` | Incompleteness: each side only one moment | 134-155 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `ratio-direct-transition-inverse` | Transition to inverse ratio: exponent as product | 157-191 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained
- ✓ Section structure (A. THE DIRECT RATIO with subsections 1, 2, 3) properly respected

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Follows Hegel's structural divisions (Introduction, Ratio in general, A. THE DIRECT RATIO)
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in transition to inverse ratio

### Key Concepts
- **Ratio**: Infinite quantum as unity of quantitative/qualitative determinateness, quantum qualitatively determined, self-enclosed totality, infinite within
- **Direct ratio**: Qualitative moment not yet explicit, contradiction of externality/self-reference, sublates to inverse ratio and ratio of powers → measure
- **Exponent**: One determinateness/limit of both quanta, qualitatively determined quantum, meaning of both determinations (quantum/amount and qualitative moment)
- **Unit and amount**: Moments appearing as quanta in ratio, delimitations against external determinateness
- **Incompleteness**: Each side only one moment (unit or amount), not complete quanta, self-subsistence negated, negative with respect to each other
- **Transition to inverse**: Exponent ought to be complete quantum but only value of amount/unit, more real ratio with exponent as product

### Structural Analysis
- **Introduction**: Ratio as quantum qualitatively determined (1 chunk)
- **Ratio in general**: Direct, inverse, ratio of powers (1 chunk)
- **A. THE DIRECT RATIO**: Exponent, incompleteness, transition to inverse (5 chunks)

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Structure properly respects Hegel's divisions
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (inverse.txt)
