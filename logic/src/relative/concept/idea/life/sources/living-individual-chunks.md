# Chunking Plan for living-individual.txt - The Living Individual

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: The Living Individual (333 lines)
- Creative presupposing, diremption into judgment and syllogism
- The living individual and organism, members and impulse
- Internal process, premise as conclusion, concept produces itself
- Sensibility, irritability, reproduction, three determinations

**Workflow**:

**TopicMap**: See `living-individual-topic-map.ts` for the formal TopicMap structure that maps to:
- `TopicMapEntry.id` → `Chunk.id`
- `TopicMapEntry.title` → `Chunk.title` AND `LogicalOperation.label` (the "Title")
- `TopicMapEntry.lineRange` → Extract text → `Chunk.text`

The TopicMap ensures systematic, trackable chunking that yields meaningful Logical Operations.

## Chunk 1: Creative Presupposing; Diremption into Judgment and Syllogism (lines 3-74)

**Text**: Opening through "a moment of the concept."

**Key Points**:
- Universal life = immediate idea, concept with corresponding objectivity
- Concept = negative unity of externality
- Infinite reference = self-determining, diremption into subjective singularity and indifferent universality
- Creative universal soul
- Self-determination = creative presupposing
- Universal life particularized, splits into judgment extremes = syllogism
- Objectivity = predicate of judgment, moment of concept

**Keywords**: universal life, immediate idea, concept, negative unity, diremption, creative presupposing, judgment, syllogism, objectivity, predicate

## Chunk 2: The Living Individual and Organism; Members and Impulse (lines 76-160)

**Text**: "According to content" through "make itself a means for the other."

**Key Points**:
- Objectivity = totality of concept, subjectivity = negative unity = true centrality = concept's free unity
- Subject = idea as singularity = living individual
- Individual = soul = self-moving principle
- Soul has objective being = corporeity = immediate means
- Organism = means/instrument of purpose, concept = substance, accomplished purpose
- Organism = manifold of members (not parts)
- Members exist only in individuality, separable but revert to mechanism/chemism when separated
- Individuality = impulse to posit concrete difference, each moment produces itself, raises particularity to universality

**Keywords**: objectivity, subjectivity, negative unity, living individual, soul, corporeity, organism, members, impulse, particularity, universality

## Chunk 3: Internal Process; Premise as Conclusion; Concept Produces Itself (lines 162-204)

**Text**: "2. This process" through "or as the process of production."

**Key Points**:
- Process restricted to individuality
- First premise = premise also conclusion
- Immediate reference = negative unity of concept
- Purpose realizes itself = subjective power, externality self-dissolves, returns to negative unity
- Unrest/mutability = manifestation of concept
- Concept = negativity, objectivity shows self-sublating
- Concept produces itself through impulse, product = producing factor = process of production

**Keywords**: process, premise, conclusion, negative unity, purpose, externality, concept, impulse, product, production

## Chunk 4: Sensibility, Irritability, Reproduction; Three Determinations (lines 206-331)

**Text**: "3. Now the idea" through end of file.

**Key Points**:
- Living objectivity = ensouled by concept, determinations = universality/particularity/singularity
- Universality = sensibility = internal pulsating, infinite determinable receptivity, reflected into itself, external existence of inward soul
- Particularity = irritability = posited difference, opening negativity, impulse, self-determination = judgment
- Singularity = reproduction = immanent reflection sublating immediacy, theoretical/real reflection, concrete/vital, totality of all moments
- Reproduction = actual individuality, self-referring, outward reference, passes over to presupposed objectivity

**Keywords**: sensibility, irritability, reproduction, universality, particularity, singularity, immanent reflection, totality, actual individuality
