## Overview

The Advance is the second moment of the method. The concrete totality which makes the beginning possesses as such, within it, the beginning of the advance and development. As concrete, it is differentiated in itself, but because of its initial immediacy, this first differentiation is to start with a diversity. However, as self-referring universality, as subject, the immediate is also the unity of this diversity. This reflection is the first stage of the forward movement, the emergence of non-indifference, judgment, and determining in general. Essential is that the method find, and recognize, the determination of the universal within it. The absolute method, on the contrary, does not behave in this manner of external reflection but takes the determinate from its subject matter, for it is itself its immanent principle and its soul. To this extent the method of absolute cognition is analytic. Equally so, however, is the method synthetic, for its subject matter, while immediately determined as the simple universal, through the determinateness which it has in its very immediacy and universality, proves to be an other. This no less synthetic than analytic moment of the judgment through which the initial universal determines itself from within itself as the other of itself is to be called the dialectical moment. Dialectic is one of those ancient sciences that have been the most misjudged in the metaphysics of the moderns. It must be regarded as an infinitely important step that dialectic is once more being recognized as necessary to reason, although the result that must be drawn from it is the opposite than Kant drew. The negativity just considered constitutes the turning point of the movement of the concept. It is the simple point of the negative self-reference, the innermost source of all activity, of living and spiritual self-movement; it is the dialectical soul which everything true possesses and through which alone it is true. The second negative at which we have arrived, the negative of the negative, is this sublating of contradiction, and it too, just like contradiction, is not an act of external reflection; for it is on the contrary the innermost, objective moment of the life of spirit by virtue of which a subject is a person, is free. The third or the fourth is in general the unity of the first and the second moment, of the immediate and the mediated. That it is this unity, or that the entire form of the method is a triplicity, is indeed nothing but the merely superficial, external side of cognition. The syllogism, or the threefold, has always been recognized to be the universal form of reason. The result can again be beginning. The method is analytic + synthetic, remains same on new foundation. Content enters circle of consideration, method expands into system. The determinateness which was the result is now a new beginning. Cognition rolls onwards from content to content. Forward movement: simple determinacies → richer/concrete. Universal = foundation, advance not flowing from other to other. Concept maintains itself in otherness, universal in particularization. Universal elevates preceding content, carries all gained, enriched/compressed. Each step = getting away from beginning + getting back closer. Retrogressive grounding = progressive determination. Method coils in circle, circle of circles. Logic returned to simple unity = beginning. Method = pure concept relating to itself = being = fulfilled concept = concrete intensive totality.

## Structure

### Analytic and synthetic method — Dialectical moment (lines 1-99)
**Immanent principle and soul**: The concrete totality which makes the beginning possesses as such, within it, the beginning of the advance and development. As concrete, it is differentiated in itself, but because of its initial immediacy, this first differentiation is to start with a diversity. However, as self-referring universality, as subject, the immediate is also the unity of this diversity. This reflection is the first stage of the forward movement, the emergence of non-indifference, judgment, and determining in general. Essential is that the method find, and recognize, the determination of the universal within it. Whatever in this abstractive generation of the universal is left out of the concrete is then picked up, still externally, by the finite cognition of the understanding. This is how the latter operates. The absolute method, on the contrary, does not behave in this manner of external reflection but takes the determinate from its subject matter, for it is itself its immanent principle and its soul. This is what Plato demanded of cognition, that it should consider things in and for themselves; on the one hand, that it should consider them in their universality; on the other hand, that it should not stray away from them while it grasps at circumstances, examples, and comparisons, but, on the contrary, should keep only them in view before it and bring to consciousness what is immanent in them. To this extent the method of absolute cognition is analytic. That the method finds the further determinations of its initial universal simply and solely in this universal, constitutes the concept's absolute objectivity, of which the method is the certainty. Equally so, however, is the method synthetic, for its subject matter, while immediately determined as the simple universal, through the determinateness which it has in its very immediacy and universality, proves to be an other. Yet this connection in diversity that the subject matter is thus in itself, is no longer a synthesis as understood in finite cognition; the no less thoroughly analytic determination of the subject matter, the fact that the connection is within the concept, already distinguishes it fully from the latter synthesis. This no less synthetic than analytic moment of the judgment through which the initial universal determines itself from within itself as the other of itself is to be called the dialectical moment. Dialectic is one of those ancient sciences that have been the most misjudged in the metaphysics of the moderns, and in general also by popular philosophy, both ancient and recent. Diogenes Laërtius said of Plato that, just as Thales was the founder of natural philosophy and Socrates of moral philosophy, so Plato was the founder of the third of the sciences that belong to philosophy, of dialectic, a contribution for which he was highly esteemed by the ancients but that often goes quite unnoticed by those who have the most to say about him. Dialectic has often been regarded as an art, as if it rested on a subjective talent and did not belong to the objectivity of the concept. What shape it received in Kantian philosophy, and with what result, has already been indicated in representative examples of that philosophy's view. It must be regarded as an infinitely important step that dialectic is once more being recognized as necessary to reason, although the result that must be drawn from it is the opposite than Kant drew.

### Dialectic — History, forms, and prejudice (lines 100-225)
**True subject matter and content of reason**: When dialectic is not presented, as it generally is, as something incidental, it usually assumes the following more precise form. It is shown of a subject matter or other (for instance: world, movement, point, and so on) that a certain determination accrues to it (for instance, in the order of the just mentioned examples: finitude in space or time, being at this place, absolute negation of space), also the opposite determinations can then just as necessarily be shown to accrue to it (for example: infinity in space and time, not-being at this place, reference to space and hence spatiality). The older Eleatic school directed its dialectic especially against motion; Plato commonly did it against accepted notions and concepts of his time, in particular those of the Sophists, but also against the pure categories and the determinations of reflection; the later and more sophisticated form of skepticism extended it not only to the immediate so-called facts of consciousness and the maxims of ordinary life, but also to all scientific concepts. Now the conclusion drawn from this kind of dialectic is in general the contradiction and nullity of the asserted claims. But this can happen in two ways either in the objective sense, that the subject matter that thus contradicts itself internally cancels itself and is a non-thing (this was, for instance, the conclusion of the Eleatics, who denied the truth of the world, of movement, of the point); or in the subjective sense, that cognition is deficient. The fundamental prejudice here is that dialectic has only a negative result, a point about which more in a moment. First, regarding the said form in which dialectic usually makes its appearance, it is to be observed that according to that form the dialectic and its result affect a subject matter which is previously assumed or also the subjective cognition of it, and declare either the latter or the subject matter to be null and void, while, on the contrary, no attention is given to the determinations which are exhibited in the subject matter as in a third thing and presupposed as valid for themselves. To have called attention to this uncritical procedure has been the infinite merit of the Kantian philosophy, and in so doing to have given the impetus to the restoration of logic and dialectic understood as the examination of thought determinations in and for themselves. The subject matter, as it is apart from thought and conceptualization, is a picture representation or also a name; it is in the determinations of thought and of the concept that it is what it is. In fact, therefore, everything rests on these determinations; they are the true subject matter and content of reason, and anything else that might be understood by subject matter and content in distinction from them has meaning only through them and in them. It must not therefore be taken as the fault of a subject matter or of the cognition that these determinations, because of what they are and the way they are externally joined, prove to be dialectical. On this assumption, the subject matter and the cognition are imagined to be a subject on which the determinations are brought to bear, in the form of predicates, properties, or self-subsistent universals, as fixed and independently correct, so that these determinations are brought into dialectical relations and incur contradiction only by extraneous and contingent conjunction in and by a third thing. But this kind of external and fixed subject of imagination and understanding, and also these abstract determinations, cannot be regarded as ultimates, as secure and permanent substrates. On the contrary, they are to be regarded as themselves immediate, precisely the kind of presuppositions and starting points which, as we have shown above, must succumb to dialectic in and for themselves, because they are to be taken as in themselves the concept. The same applies to all oppositions that are assumed as fixed, as for example the finite and the infinite, the singular and the universal. These are not in contradiction through some external conjoining; on the contrary, as an examination of their nature shows, they are a transition in and for themselves; the synthesis and the subject in which they appear is the product of their concept's own reflection. If a consideration that avoids the concept stops short at their external relation, isolates them and leaves them as fixed presuppositions, it is the concept that, on the contrary, will fix its sight on them, move them as their soul and bring out their dialectic. Now this is the very standpoint indicated above from which a universal prius, considered in and for itself, proves to be the other of itself. Taken quite generally, this determination can be taken to mean that what is at first immediate is therewith posited as mediated, as referred to an other, or that the universal is posited as a particular. The second universal that has thereby arisen is thus the negative of that first and, in view of subsequent developments, the first negative. From this negative side, the immediate has perished in the other; but the other is essentially not an empty negative, the nothing which is normally taken to be the result of dialectic, but is rather the other of the first, the negative of the immediate; it is therefore determined as the mediated, contains as such the determination of the first in it. The first is thus essentially preserved and contained also in the other. To hold fast to the positive in its negative, to the content of the presupposition in the result, this is the most important factor in rational cognition; what is more, it takes only the simplest of reflections to be convinced of the absolute truth and necessity of this requirement, and as for examples of proofs that testify to this, the whole Logic consists of such proofs.

### Negativity and triplicity — The third as truth (lines 226-410)
**Dialectical soul**: So what we now have, taken first or also immediately, is the mediated, also a simple determination, for the first has perished in it, and only the second is therefore at hand. Now since the first is contained in the second, and this second is the truth of the first, this unity of the two can be expressed in the form of a proposition in which the immediate is placed as the subject but the mediated as its predicate; for example, "the finite is infinite," "one is many," "the singular is the universal." The inadequacy of the form of such propositions and judgments is however obvious. In connection with judgment it was shown that its form in general, and most of all the immediate form of the positive judgment, is incapable of holding within its grasp the speculative content and the truth. The second determination, the negative or mediated determination, is moreover at the same time the one that mediates. At first it may be taken as a simple determination, but its truth is that it is a reference or relation; for it is the negative, but the negative of the positive, and it includes this positive within itself. It is the other, therefore, not of a one to which it is indifferent; in that case it would not be an other, nor a reference or relation. It is rather the other in itself, the other of an other; hence it includes its own other within itself and is consequently the contradiction, the posited dialectic, of itself. Because the first or the immediate is the concept in itself or implicitly, and therefore is the negative also only implicitly, the dialectical moment in it consists in the positing of the difference that is implicitly contained in it. The second is on the contrary itself the determinate, the difference or relation; hence the dialectical moment consists in its case in the positing of the unity contained within it. For this reason, if the negative, the determinate, relation, judgment, and all the determinations falling under this second moment, do not appear by themselves already as contradiction, as dialectical, this is solely a defect on the part of thinking that fails to bring its thoughts together. For the material, the opposed determinations in one connection, are already posited, already present for thought. But formal thinking makes identity its law, lets the contradictory content that it has before it fall into the sphere of representation, in space and time, where the contradictory is held in external moments, next to and following each other, parading before consciousness without reciprocal contact. The firm principle that formal thinking lays down for itself here is that contradiction cannot be thought. But in fact the thought of contradiction is the essential moment of the concept. Formal thought does in fact think it, only it at once looks away from it and stating its principle it only passes over from it into abstract negation. Now the negativity just considered constitutes the turning point of the movement of the concept. It is the simple point of the negative self-reference, the innermost source of all activity, of living and spiritual self-movement; it is the dialectical soul which everything true possesses and through which alone it is true; for on this subjectivity alone rests the sublation of the opposition between concept and reality, and the unity which is truth. The second negative at which we have arrived, the negative of the negative, is this sublating of contradiction, and it too, just like contradiction, is not an act of external reflection; for it is on the contrary the innermost, objective moment of the life of spirit by virtue of which a subject is a person, is free. The self-reference of the negative is to be regarded as the second premise of the entire syllogism. If the terms analytic and synthetic are used as opposites, the first premise may be regarded as the analytic moment, for in it the immediate relates to its other immediately and therefore passes over, or rather has passed over, into it though this connection, as already remarked, is for this very reason also synthetic, for it is its other that it passes over into. The second premise considered here may be defined as synthetic, because it is the connection of the differentiated, as differentiated, to that from which it is differentiated. Just as the first premise is the moment of universality and communication, so is the second determined by singularity; a singularity which in referring to the other is at first exclusive, for itself, and different. The negative appears as the mediating factor, because it holds itself and the immediate of which it is the negation within itself. In so far as these two determinations are taken as referring to each other externally in some relation or other, the negative is only the formal mediating factor; but, as absolute negativity, the negative moment of absolute mediation is the unity which is subjectivity and soul. In this turning point of the method, the course of cognition returns at the same time back into itself. This negativity is as self-sublating contradiction the restoration of the first immediacy, of simple universality; for the other of the other, the negative of the negative, is immediately the positive, the identical, the universal. In the whole course, if one at all cares to count, this second immediate is third to the first immediate and the mediated. But it is also third to the first or formal negative and to the absolute negativity or second negative; now in so far as that first negative is already the second term, the term counted as third can also be counted as fourth, and instead of a triplicity, the abstract form may also be taken to be a quadruplicity; in this way the negative or the difference is counted as a duality. The third or the fourth is in general the unity of the first and the second moment, of the immediate and the mediated. That it is this unity, or that the entire form of the method is a triplicity, is indeed nothing but the merely superficial, external side of cognition; but to have also demonstrated this superficiality, and to have done it in the context of a specific application (for the abstract form of number has been around for a long time, as is well known, but without conceptual comprehension and therefore without any result) is again to be regarded as an infinite merit of the Kantian philosophy. The syllogism, or the threefold, has always been recognized to be the universal form of reason; but it has had in general the value of a wholly external form that does not determine the nature of the content; moreover, since in its formalism it gets caught up in the understanding's determination of mere identity, it lacks the essential dialectical moment of negativity; and yet this moment enters into the triplicity of the determinations, because the third term is the unity of the two first determinations and these, since they are diverse, can be in unity only as sublated.

### Result as new beginning — System expansion (lines 411-560)
**Method expands into system**: Now, on closer examination, the third is immediate through the sublation of mediation, is the simple through the sublation of difference, is the positive through the sublation of the negative, the concept that has realized itself through its otherness and through the sublation of this reality has united with itself and has restored its absolute reality, its universality. The result is therefore the truth. It is also immediacy and simplicity, because it is free of mediation and of the negative, which are not posited; it is therefore just as simple as the beginning. But as the result, as the negative unity of the first, it is essentially determined as the result, as the negative of the first. The result is therefore a new beginning. The method, which in this way expands into a system, is not to be regarded as a series of determinations that are only externally strung together; on the contrary, it is the nature of the method to be at the same time analytic and synthetic. The method is analytic in so far as it begins with the immediate, the simple, and the subsequent moments add nothing new but only bring out what is contained in the immediate. But the method is equally synthetic in so far as the subject matter, being at first the simple universal, without any relation to an other, shows itself to be an other and to be related to an other. The method, however, is not only analytic and synthetic at the same time; it is rather the case that each of its moments is as much analytic as synthetic. This is so because, as we have seen, each step of the advance in the process of further determination, while getting away from its beginning, is also a getting back closer to it, so that what at first appears as different—the retrogressive grounding of the beginning and the progressive further determination of it—coincide and are the same. The advance is therefore not a kind of superfluity; this is what it would be if that which is at the beginning were already the absolute; the advance consists rather in this, that the universal determines itself and is the universal for itself, that is, equally a singular and a subject. Only in its consummation is it the absolute. The method, which in this way expands into a system, is not to be regarded as a series of determinations that are only externally strung together; on the contrary, it is the nature of the method to be at the same time analytic and synthetic. The method is analytic in so far as it begins with the immediate, the simple, and the subsequent moments add nothing new but only bring out what is contained in the immediate.

The result is therefore a new beginning.

The beginning is indeterminate, the method is the formal soul. The subject matter receives determinateness as content. The negativity withdrawn is the sublated form, the simple determinateness.

### Infinite progression and method's self-mediation (lines 561-710)
**System of totality**: Now since this determinateness is the proximate truth of the beginning, it denounces the incompleteness of the beginning. The demand is made that the beginning should not be immediate but should be mediated and deduced. This demand appears as an infinite retrogression or progression. The infinite progression is a reflection void of concept. The absolute method cannot lead into an infinite progression. The logical beginnings (being, essence, universality) are immediate and indeterminate. The indeterminacy is itself a determinateness (negativity, sublated mediation). The method is the absolute form, the concept knows itself, no content stands out. The determinateness is self-mediation, it converts the immediate into a mediated beginning. The method runs its course through the content, back to the beginning, restoration. This it accomplishes as a system of totality.

### Forward movement and circle of circles (lines 711-735)
**Fulfilled concept**: The determinateness which was the result is now a new beginning. Cognition rolls onwards from content to content. Forward movement: simple determinacies → richer/concrete. Universal = foundation, advance not flowing from other to other. Concept maintains itself in otherness, universal in particularization. Universal elevates preceding content, carries all gained, enriched/compressed. Expansion = moment of content, first premise. Enrichment = necessity of concept, reflection into itself. Extension/intensity: greater extension = denser intensity. Richest = most concrete/subjective. Pure personality = highest/intense point, embraces everything. Each step = getting away from beginning + getting back closer. Retrogressive grounding = progressive determination. Method coils in circle, circle of circles. Logic returned to simple unity = beginning. Method = pure concept relating to itself = being = fulfilled concept = concrete intensive totality.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Concrete Totality as Beginning**: Concrete totality = beginning of advance. Differentiated in itself, but immediacy = diversity. Self-referring universality = unity of diversity. Reflection = first stage = non-indifference/judgment/determining.

2. **Absolute Method**: Method finds determination of universal within it. Absolute method = immanent principle/soul, takes determinate from subject matter. Method = analytic (finds determinations in universal) + synthetic (universal proves to be other). Connection in diversity = within concept.

3. **Dialectical Moment**: Dialectical moment = judgment through which universal determines itself as other. Dialectic = necessary to reason.

4. **Dialectic History**: Dialectic form: opposite determinations shown to accrue to subject matter. Eleatics, Plato, skepticism: dialectic against motion, notions, concepts. Conclusion = contradiction/nullity (objective or subjective sense). Prejudice: dialectic = only negative result.

5. **True Subject Matter**: Determinations = true subject matter/content of reason. Determinations prove dialectical in themselves. Universal prius = other of itself. Immediate = mediated, universal = particular. Second universal = negative of first = first negative. Other = not empty negative, contains first, first preserved. **Hold fast to positive in negative = important factor**.

6. **Negativity as Turning Point**: Second = truth of first, unity expressed. Second = mediates, reference/relation, includes positive, contradiction. Dialectical moment = positing difference (first) or unity (second). **Negativity = turning point, negative self-reference, innermost source, dialectical soul**. Second negative = sublation of contradiction, innermost moment of spirit.

7. **Third as Truth**: Third = immediate through sublation of mediation, concept realized through otherness, truth. Result = singular/concrete/subject, universal posited in subject. Triplicity/quadruplicity: third = unity of first/second, immediate/mediated. **Syllogism/threefold = universal form of reason**.

8. **Result as New Beginning**: Third = concept realized through otherness, truth, immediacy/mediation. Result = whole withdrawn into itself, form of immediacy, universal. Result can again be beginning. Method = analytic + synthetic, remains same on new foundation. Content enters circle of consideration, method expands into system.

9. **Infinite Progression**: Determinateness = proximate truth of beginning, denounces incompleteness. Demand: beginning = mediated/deduced (not immediate). Appears as infinite retrogression/progression. Infinite progression = reflection void of concept. **Absolute method cannot lead into infinite progression**. Logical beginnings (being, essence, universality) = immediate/indeterminate. Indeterminacy = determinateness (negativity, sublated mediation). Method = absolute form, concept knows itself, no content stands out. Determinateness = self-mediation, converts immediate to mediated beginning. Method runs course through content, back to beginning, restoration. Accomplishes as system of totality.

10. **Circle of Circles**: Result = new beginning (form of simplicity). Cognition rolls onwards from content to content. Forward movement: simple determinacies → richer/concrete. Universal = foundation, advance not flowing from other to other. Concept maintains itself in otherness, universal in particularization. Universal elevates preceding content, carries all gained, enriched/compressed. Expansion = moment of content, first premise. Enrichment = necessity of concept, reflection into itself. Extension/intensity: greater extension = denser intensity. Richest = most concrete/subjective. Pure personality = highest/intense point, embraces everything. Each step = getting away from beginning + getting back closer. Retrogressive grounding = progressive determination. **Method coils in circle, circle of circles**. Logic returned to simple unity = beginning. **Method = pure concept relating to itself = being = fulfilled concept = concrete intensive totality**.
