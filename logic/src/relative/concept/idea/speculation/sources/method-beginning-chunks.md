# Chunking Plan for method-beginning.txt - The Beginning

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: The Beginning (154 lines)
- Method as determinations of concept
- Beginning as simple and universal
- Absolute as implicit, advance as exposition

**Workflow**: 
```
Source Text → [Source Analysis] → Chunks + Topics → [Logical Op Generation] → Logical Operations
```

**TopicMap**: See `method-beginning-topic-map.ts` for the formal TopicMap structure that maps to:
- `TopicMapEntry.id` → `Chunk.id`
- `TopicMapEntry.title` → `Chunk.title` AND `LogicalOperation.label` (the "Title")
- `TopicMapEntry.lineRange` → Extract text → `Chunk.text`

The TopicMap ensures systematic, trackable chunking that yields meaningful Logical Operations.

## Chunk 1: Beginning as Simple and Universal (lines 1-66)

**Text**: Opening through "entire subsequent development of cognition."

**Key Points**:
- Method = determinations of concept and connections
- Beginning = simple nature
- Content = immediate = abstract universality
- Not sense-intuition/representation, but thought = supersensuous inner intuiting
- Beginning = simple/universal in element of thought
- Universality = immediate universality = being (abstract self-reference)
- Being needs no derivation
- Universal = immediate = abstract self-reference = being
- Demand for being exhibited = demand for realization of concept (goal of development)

**Keywords**: method, beginning, immediate, abstract universality, thought, being, abstract self-reference, realization of concept

## Chunk 2: Beginning as Deficient - Absolute as Implicit (lines 68-123)

**Text**: "The beginning, therefore, has for the method" through "Only in its consummation is it the absolute."

**Key Points**:
- Beginning = simple/universal (deficient)
- Universality = pure simple concept, only moment, concept not determined
- Method objective/immanent: beginning has lack, impulse to carry further
- Absolute method: universal = objective universal = concrete totality (not posited/for itself)
- Abstract universal = posited afflicted by negation
- Nothing so simple/abstract
- Beginning = immediate = in-itself without being-for-itself
- Every beginning = absolute (implicit in existence = concept)
- Absolute implicit = not absolute/not posited concept/not idea
- Advance = universal determines itself = universal for itself = singular/subject
- Consummation = absolute

**Keywords**: beginning, deficient, universality, pure simple concept, objective universal, concrete totality, absolute, implicit, advance, consummation

## Chunk 3: Concrete Totality as Beginning (lines 125-153)

**Text**: "It may also be mentioned that a beginning" through end.

**Key Points**:
- Beginning in itself concrete totality = free, immediacy = external existence
- Germ of living, subjective purpose = such beginnings = impulses
- Non-spiritual/inanimate = concrete concept only as real possibility
- Cause = highest stage in necessity, immediate existence, but not subject maintaining itself
- Inanimate = determinate concrete existences, real possibility = inner totality
- Moments not posited in subjective form, attain concrete existence through other corporeal individuals

**Keywords**: concrete totality, beginning, germ, living, subjective purpose, impulse, real possibility, cause, inanimate, corporeal individuals
