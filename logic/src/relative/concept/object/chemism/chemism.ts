/**
 * TRANSITION OF CHEMISM - Achievement of Scientific Cognition
 * =========================================================
 *
 * "The concept that has thus sublated as external all the moments of its objective existence,
 * and has posited them in its simple unity, is thereby completely liberated from
 * the objective externality to which it refers only as an unessential reality.
 * This objective free concept is purpose."
 *
 * ACHIEVEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC COGNITION STRUCTURE:
 * 1. SELF-CREATING PRESUPPOSITIONS (Object creates its own conditions)
 * 2. THREE SYLLOGISMS TOTALITY (Complete cognitive architecture)
 * 3. PROGRESSIVE SUBLATION OF EXTERNALITY (Achieving objectivity)
 * 4. OBJECTIVE FREE CONCEPT = PURPOSE (Science proper achieved)
 *
 * This IS the achievement of scientific cognition - the transition from
 * conditioned to unconditioned cognition, from externality to self-determination.
 *
 * THE END OF THE THEORY OF SCIENCE - PURPOSE BEGINS SCIENCE PROPER!

    SCIENTIFIC COGNITION ACHIEVEMENT PATTERNS:

    1. SELF-CREATING PRESUPPOSITIONS:
    - Objects create their own conditions for connection (oxidation example)
    - Scientific method as self-conditioning cognition
    - Inner totality of original relations (systematic approach)
    - Self-given middle term (scientific mediation)
    - Concrete concept as principle of analysis/synthesis unity

    2. THREE SYLLOGISMS TOTALITY:
    - First: Formal neutrality (neutral observation)
    - Second: Real neutrality (active engagement)
    - Third: Self-realizing concept (self-conditioning universal)
    - But they still fall apart due to remaining externality

    3. PROGRESSIVE SUBLATION OF EXTERNALITY:
    - First process: Sublates externality of extremes
    - Second process: Sublates externality of real unity
    - Third process: Sublates abstract external immediacy
    - Achievement of complete objectivity

    4. OBJECTIVE FREE CONCEPT = PURPOSE:
    - Completely liberated from objective externality
    - Self-determining cognition achieved
    - PURPOSE = SCIENCE PROPER
    - End of Theory of Science → Beginning of Science proper

    "You must achieve the Concept before you can use it" - NOW ACHIEVED!
