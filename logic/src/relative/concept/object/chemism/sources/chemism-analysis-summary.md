## Overview

Chemism is the first negation of indifferent objectivity and of the externality of determinateness. It is still burdened by the immediate self-subsistence of the object and with externality. Through three syllogisms, externality and conditionality are sublated, and the concept emerges as determined in and for itself, unconditioned by externality. The objective free concept is purpose. This transition shows how chemism prepares the move to Teleology (purpose) as the third moment of Objectivity.

## Structure

### Example - Object posits presupposition (lines 4-23)
**Inner totality and middle term**: Even ordinary chemistry shows examples of chemical alterations in which a body, for example, imparts a higher oxidation to one part of its mass and thereby reduces another part to a lower degree of the same, at which degree alone it can enter into a neutral combination with another differing body brought into contact with it. What happens here is that the object does not connect with another in accordance with an immediate, one-sided determinateness, but, in accordance with the inner totality of an original relation, posits the presupposition which it needs for a real connection and thereby gives itself a middle term by virtue of which it unites its concept with its reality in conclusion. It is a singularity determined in and for itself, the concrete concept as the principle of the disjunction into extremes whose re-union is the activity of that same negative principle that thereby returns to its first determination, but returns to it objectified.

### Chemism as first negation, three syllogisms (lines 25-63)
**First negation of indifferent objectivity**: Chemism is itself the first negation of the indifferent objectivity and of the externality of determinateness. It is still burdened, therefore, by the immediate self-subsistence of the object and with externality. Consequently it is not yet for itself that totality of self-determination that proceeds from it and in which it is rather sublated. The three syllogisms that have resulted constitute its totality. The first has formal neutrality for its middle term and for extremes the objects in tension. The second has for its middle term the product of the first, real neutrality; and for extremes the disrupting activity and its product, the indifferent element. But the third is the self-realizing concept that posits for itself the presupposition by virtue of which the process of its realization is conditioned: a syllogism that has the universal for its essence. Yet, on account of the immediacy and externality by which the chemical objectivity is still determined, these three syllogisms fall apart. The first process whose product is the neutrality of the tensed objects is extinguished in this product and is re-activated only by a differentiation that comes to it from outside. The excretion out of the neutral product of the non-indifferent extremes, as also their decomposition into their abstract elements, must likewise proceed from conditions and stimulations of activity brought in from the outside.

### Two essential moments - neutralization and dissolution (lines 64-78)
**Bound together in one process**: But the two essential moments of the process, neutralization on the one hand and dissolution and reduction on the other, since they too are bound together in one and the same process and the union blunting the tension of the extremes is also a separation into these, constitute on account of the still underlying externality two diverse sides. The extremes that are separated in that same process are other than the objects or matters uniting in it. In so far as the former proceed from it again as non-indifferent, they must turn outwards. Their renewed neutralization is a process other than the one that took place in the first.

### Processes as stages sublating externality (lines 80-91)
**Concept emerges unconditioned**: But these various processes, which have demonstrated themselves to be necessary, are equally so many stages by which externality and conditionality are sublated, and from which the concept emerges as determined in and for itself, a totality unconditioned by externality. In the first process, what is sublated is the externality of the mutually non-indifferent extremes that constitute the whole reality, or the distinction between the implicitly determinate concept and its existing determinateness.

### Second process - sublation of real unity (lines 92-105)
**Concept's own mediation**: Sublated in the second process is the externality of the real unity, union as merely neutral. Or more precisely, the formal activity sublates itself in bases that are equally formal, neutral determinacies whose inner concept is now the absolute activity that has withdrawn into itself and now realizes itself internally, that is, posits the determinate difference within itself and through this mediation constitutes itself as real unity. This is a mediation which is thus the concept's own mediation, its self-determination and, considering that in it the concept reflects itself back into itself, an immanent presupposing.

### Third syllogism - concept liberated, purpose (lines 106-119)
**Objective free concept is purpose**: The third syllogism, which on the one hand is the restoration of the preceding processes, sublates on the other hand the last remaining moment of indifferent bases: it sublates the whole abstract external immediacy that becomes in this way the concept's own moment of self-mediation. The concept that has thus sublated as external all the moments of its objective existence, and has posited them in its simple unity, is thereby completely liberated from the objective externality to which it refers only as an unessential reality. **This objective free concept is purpose**.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Object Posits Presupposition**: Object does not connect with another in accordance with immediate, one-sided determinateness, but in accordance with inner totality of original relation. Posits presupposition which needs for real connection. Gives itself middle term by virtue of which unites concept with reality in conclusion.

2. **First Negation**: Chemism is itself the first negation of the indifferent objectivity and of the externality of determinateness. Still burdened by immediate self-subsistence of object and with externality.

3. **Three Syllogisms**: Three syllogisms constitute totality. First: formal neutrality for middle term, objects in tension for extremes. Second: product of first (real neutrality) for middle term, disrupting activity and product for extremes. Third: self-realizing concept that posits for itself presupposition.

4. **Syllogisms Fall Apart**: On account of immediacy and externality by which chemical objectivity still determined, three syllogisms fall apart. First process extinguished in product, re-activated only by differentiation from outside.

5. **Two Essential Moments**: Neutralization on one hand and dissolution and reduction on the other. Bound together in one and the same process. Union blunting tension of extremes also separation into these.

6. **Stages Sublating Externality**: Various processes are equally so many stages by which externality and conditionality are sublated. From which concept emerges as determined in and for itself, **totality unconditioned by externality**.

7. **Concept's Own Mediation**: Formal activity sublates itself in bases equally formal. Inner concept is absolute activity that has withdrawn into itself and now realizes itself internally. This is concept's own mediation, its self-determination, immanent presupposing.

8. **Purpose**: Concept completely liberated from objective externality to which it refers only as unessential reality. **This objective free concept is purpose**.

## Dialectical Movement

1. **Object Posits Presupposition** (inner totality, middle term)
2. **First Negation** (three syllogisms)
3. **Two Essential Moments** (neutralization and dissolution)
4. **Stages Sublating Externality** (concept emerges unconditioned)
5. **Concept's Own Mediation** (self-determination, immanent presupposing)
6. **Purpose** (objective free concept)

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows: example → first negation → three syllogisms → stages → concept's own mediation → purpose
- The key insight is that **chemism sublates externality through three syllogisms, leading to purpose**
- The three syllogisms fall apart due to immediacy and externality
- The concept emerges as determined in and for itself, unconditioned by externality
- This prepares the transition to Teleology (purpose) as the third moment of Objectivity
