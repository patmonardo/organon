/**
 * TopicMap for chemism.txt - C. TRANSITION OF CHEMISM
 *
 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the transition from Chemism to Teleology.
 * Chemism is the first negation of indifferent objectivity. Through three syllogisms, externality
 * and conditionality are sublated, and the concept emerges as determined in and for itself,
 * unconditioned by externality. The objective free concept is purpose.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - Example: Object posits presupposition
 * - Chemism as first negation, three syllogisms
 * - Two essential moments: neutralization and dissolution
 * - Processes as stages sublating externality
 * - Third syllogism: concept liberated, purpose

    description: "Even ordinary chemistry shows examples of chemical alterations in which a body, for example, imparts a higher oxidation to one part of its mass and thereby reduces another part to a lower degree of the same, at which degree alone it can enter into a neutral combination with another differing body brought into contact with it, a combination to which it would not have been receptive at that other first immediate degree. What happens here is that the object does not connect with another in accordance with an immediate, one-sided determinateness, but, in accordance with the inner totality of an original relation, posits the presupposition which it needs for a real connection and thereby gives itself a middle term by virtue of which it unites its concept with its reality in conclusion; it is a singularity determined in and for itself, the concrete concept as the principle of the disjunction into extremes whose re-union is the activity of that same negative principle that thereby returns to its first determination, but returns to it objectified.",

    description: "Chemism is itself the first negation of the indifferent objectivity and of the externality of determinateness; it is still burdened, therefore, by the immediate self-subsistence of the object and with externality. Consequently it is not yet for itself that totality of self-determination that proceeds from it and in which it is rather sublated. The three syllogisms that have resulted constitute its totality. The first has formal neutrality for its middle term and for extremes the objects in tension. The second has for its middle term the product of the first, real neutrality; and for extremes the disrupting activity and its product, the indifferent element. But the third is the self-realizing concept that posits for itself the presupposition by virtue of which the process of its realization is conditioned: a syllogism that has the universal for its essence. Yet, on account of the immediacy and externality by which the chemical objectivity is still determined, these three syllogisms fall apart. The first process whose product is the neutrality of the tensed objects is extinguished in this product and is re-activated only by a differentiation that comes to it from outside; conditioned by an immediate presupposition, the process is exhausted in it. The excretion out of the neutral product of the non-indifferent extremes, as also their decomposition into their abstract elements, must likewise proceed from conditions and stimulations of activity brought in from the outside.",
