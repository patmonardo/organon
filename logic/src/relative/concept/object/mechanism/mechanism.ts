    MECHANICAL COGNITIVE PATTERNS:

    CENTER FORMATION (Cognitive Focus):
    - Gathering empty manifoldness into objective singularity
    - Simple self-determining middle point as cognitive anchor
    - Central body as individualized universality of cognitive processes
    - Striving towards center as absolute universality (not through communication)
    - Three-fold syllogistic structure as complete cognitive architecture

    LAW DETERMINATION (Cognitive Pattern):
    - Idealized reality vs external reality distinction
    - Self-determining unity as principle of self-movement
    - Law as "inexhaustible source of self-igniting fire"
    - Free necessity - law refers only to itself in ideality of difference
    - Beyond dead mechanism's rules to living cognitive law

    TRANSITION TO CHEMISM (Cognitive Affinity):
    - Soul still immersed in body - law not yet opposed to object
    - Lack of self-subsistence - no resistance to concept's judgment
    - Centrality becomes reciprocally negative and tense
    - Striving towards determinedly opposed object
    - Free mechanism determines itself to chemism

    This IS the complete mechanical cognitive architecture!
    How consciousness operates through mechanical patterns before
    developing chemical affinities and teleological purposes!
