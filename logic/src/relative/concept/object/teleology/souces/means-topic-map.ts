 * TopicMap for means.txt - B. THE MEANS
 *
 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the means.
 * The means is the middle term connecting subjective purpose with objective purpose.
 * Shows how purpose realizes itself through external objects.
 * Means is both external and internal to purpose.
 * Prepares transition to realized purpose.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - First positing and presupposing, second determining as sublation
 * - Means as formal middle term, external to extremes
 * - Means as mechanical object, concept and objectivity externally linked
 * - Means as totality, penetrable by purpose, powerless and serving
 * - Activity of purpose through means still directed against presupposition

But the subjectivity of purpose is the absolutely negative unity; its second determining is, therefore, the sublation of this presupposition as such; this sublation is an immanent turning back inasmuch as that moment of the first negation which is the positing of the negative over against the subject, the external object, is sublated by it. But as against the presupposition or the immediacy of the determining, as against the objective world, it is as yet only the first, itself immediate and hence external negation. This positing is therefore not yet the realized purpose itself but only the beginning of this realization. The object so determined is now the means.",

    description: "Through a means the purpose unites with objectivity and in objectivity unites with itself. This means is the middle term of the syllogism. Purpose is in need of a means for its realization, because it is finite, in need of a means, that is to say, of a middle term that has at the same time the shape of an external existence indifferent towards the purpose itself and its realization. The absolute concept has mediation within itself in such a manner that the first positing of it is not a presupposition in whose object the fundamental determination would be an indifferent externality; on the contrary, the world as creation has only the form of such an externality; it is its negativity and the positedness that rather constitute its fundamental determination. Accordingly, the finitude of purpose consists in this, that its determining is as such external to itself; accordingly, its first determining, as we have seen, falls apart into a supposing and a presupposing; the negation of this determining is therefore only according to one side already immanent reflection; according to the other side, it is rather only first negation. Or again, the immanent reflection is itself also self-external and a reflection outwards.",

Moreover, just as this particularity is a middle term by virtue of being determinateness with reference to one extreme but universality with reference to the other extreme, and therefore obtains its mediating determination by being related to an other, so too the means is a mediating middle term only because it is, first, an immediate object, and, second, because it is a means by virtue of a reference connecting it with the extreme of purpose external to it, a reference which is for it a form to which it is indifferent.",

    description: "Concept and objectivity, therefore, are in the means only externally linked; hence the means is only a merely mechanical object. The reference of the object to purpose is a premise or the immediate reference which, as we have seen, is with respect to purpose an immanent reflection; the means is an inhering predicate; its objectivity is subsumed under the determination of purpose which, on account of its concreteness, is universality. Through this purposive determination present in it, the means is now also subsumptive with respect to the other extreme, the at the moment still indeterminate objectivity. Conversely, as contrasted with the subjective purpose, the means has as immediate objectivity a universality of existence which the subjective singularity of purpose still misses. Thus, since purpose is in the means as only an external determinateness at first, it is itself, as the negative unity, outside the means; the means, for its part, is a mechanical object that possesses purpose only as a determinateness, not as the simple concretion of totality. But as the unifying means, the middle term must itself be the totality of the purpose. It has been shown that the determination of purpose is in the middle term at the same time immanent reflection; as this reflection, it is a formal self-reference, since the determinateness is posited as real indifference, as the objectivity of the middle term. But precisely for this reason this subjectivity, which is in one respect pure subjectivity, is at the same time also activity. In the subjective purpose the negative self-reference is still identical with determinateness as such, with the content and the externality. However, in the initial objectification of purpose which is a becoming-other of the simple concept, those moments come apart, each outside the other, or, conversely, the becoming-other or the externality itself consists in this coming apart.",

But further, universality is the connection of purposiveness and the means. This means is object, in itself the totality of the concept; it does not have with respect to purpose any of the power of resistance that it initially has against another immediate object. To the purpose, therefore, which is the posited concept, it is utterly penetrable, and it is receptive to this communication because it is in itself identical with it. But it is now also posited that it is penetrable by the concept, for in centrality it is an object striving towards negative unity; in chemism, too, whether as neutral or non-indifferent, it is no longer self-subsistent. Its non-self-subsistence consists precisely in its being the totality of the concept only implicitly; but the concept is being-for-itself. Consequently, with respect to purpose the object has the character of being powerless and of serving it; purpose is the subjectivity or soul of the object that has in the latter its external side.",
