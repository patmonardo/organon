## Overview

The Realized Purpose completes Teleology and Objectivity. It shows how purpose attains objectivity through means. External purposiveness transitions to inner purposive connection. Concept becomes identical with immediate objectivity. The movement of purpose has now attained this much, namely that the moment of externality is not just posited in the concept, the purpose is not just an ought and a striving, but as a concrete totality is identical with immediate objectivity. This identity is on the one hand the simple concept, and the equally immediate objectivity, but, on the other hand, it is just as essentially mediation, and it is that simple immediacy only through this mediation sublating itself as mediation. Prepares transition to Idea.

## Structure

### 1. Purpose in connection to means, activity through means, mechanism under dominance of purpose (lines 4-212)

#### Purpose in connection to means, activity directed against objectivity (lines 4-26)
**Mediation and sublation**: Purpose is in its connection to the means already reflected into itself, but its objective immanent turning back is not yet posited. The activity of purpose through its means is still directed against objectivity as an initial presupposition; this is precisely what that activity is, to be indifferent to determinateness. If it were again to consist in determining the immediate objectivity, the product would again be only a means, and so forth into infinity; only a purposeful means would result, but not the objectivity of the purpose itself. In being active in its means, therefore, purpose must not determine the immediate object as something external to it, and the object, accordingly, must merge with it in the unity of the concept through itself; or again, the otherwise external activity of purpose through its means must determine itself as mediation and thus sublate itself as external.

#### Connection through means - Second premise, mechanism under dominance (lines 27-66)
**Internal transition**: The connection of the activity of purpose with the external object through the means is first of all the second premise of the syllogism, an immediate connection of the middle term with the other extreme. It is immediate because the middle term has within it an external object and the other extreme is likewise an external object. The means is effective and potent against this latter object because its own is linked with the self-determining activity, whereas for the other the immediate determinateness that it possesses is an indifferent one. Their process in this connection is none other than the mechanical or chemical one; the previous relations come up again in this objective externality, but under the dominance of purpose. But these processes, as they themselves showed, return into purpose on their own. Since the means is therefore the object that stands on the side of purpose and has the latter's activity within it, the mechanism that occurs here is at the same time the turning back of objectivity into itself, into the concept which, however, is already presupposed as purpose; the negative attitude of the purposeful activity towards the object is therefore not an external attitude but, on the contrary, the objectivity's own alteration and internal transition into it.

#### Violence and cunning of reason (lines 68-98)
**Cunning of reason**: That the purpose immediately refers to an object and makes it into a means, as also that through this means it determines another object, may be regarded as violence inasmuch as purpose appears of an entirely different nature than the object, and the two objects are in like matter mutually independent totalities. But that the purpose posits itself in a mediate connection with the object, and between itself and this object inserts another object, may be regarded as the cunning of reason. As remarked, the finitude of rationality has this side, that purpose relates to the object as a presupposition, that is, as external. In an immediate connection with that object, purpose would itself enter into the sphere of mechanism and chemism and would therefore be subject to accidentality and to the loss of its determining vocation to be the concept that exists in and for itself. But in this way, by sending an object as a means ahead of it, it lets it do the slavish work of externality in its stead, abandons it to the wear and tear while preserving itself behind it against mechanical violence.

#### Means higher than finite purposes, tool lasts (lines 100-121)
**Tool and power**: Since it is finite, the purpose further has a finite content; accordingly, it is not rational absolutely, or simply in and for itself. But the means is the external middle term of the syllogism which is the realization of purpose; in the means, therefore, the rationality in the purpose manifests itself as such by maintaining itself in this external other, and precisely through this externality. To this extent the means is higher than the finite purposes of external purposiveness: the plough is more honorable than are immediately the enjoyments which it procures and which are the purposes. The tool lasts while the immediate enjoyments pass away and are forgotten. It is in their tools that human beings possess power over external nature, even though with respect to their purposes they are subjected to it.

#### Purpose keeps itself in mechanical process, power of purpose (lines 123-151)
**Truth of mechanism**: But the purpose does not just keep outside the mechanical process; on the contrary, it keeps itself in it and is its determination. For purpose (as the concept that concretely exists freely over against the object and its process, and is self-determining activity) since it is equally the truth of mechanism existing in and for itself, in the latter only rejoins itself. The power of purpose over the object is this identity existing for itself, and its activity is the manifestation of this identity. The purpose as content is the determinateness as it exists in and for itself, present in the object as indifferent and external; but the activity of the purpose is the truth of the process on the one side, and, as negative unity, the sublation of the reflective shine of externality. The indifferent determinateness of the object is one that can abstractly be replaced by another just as externally; but the truth of the simple abstraction of the determinateness is the totality of the negative, the concrete concept that posits the externality within itself.

#### Content of purpose, teleological process as translation (lines 153-212)
**End is beginning**: The content of the purpose is its negativity as simple determinateness reflected into itself, distinguished from its totality as form. On account of this simplicity, the determinateness of which is in and for itself the totality of the concept, the content appears as that which remains identical in the realization of the purpose. The teleological process is the translation of the concept that concretely exists distinctly as concept into objectivity; as we see, this translation into a presupposed other is the rejoining of the concept through itself with itself. The content of the purpose is now this identity concretely existing in the form of the identical. In every transition the concept maintains itself; for instance, when the cause comes to effect, it is the cause that in the effect only comes to itself. But in the teleological transition, what maintains itself is the concept that as such already concretely exists as cause, as the free concrete unity as against objectivity and its external determinateness. The externality into which the purpose translates itself is, as we have seen, itself already posited as a moment of the concept, as the form of its inner differentiation. In the externality, therefore, the purpose has its own moment; and the content, as the content of the concrete unity, is its simple form that does not remain in its different moments only implicitly equal with itself (as subjective purpose, as means and mediating activity, and as objective purpose) but also exists concretely as abidingly self-equal. **Of the teleological activity one can say, therefore, that in it the end is the beginning, the consequence the ground, the effect the cause; that it is a becoming of what has become; that in it only that which already concretely exists comes into existence, and so on; that is to say, that quite in general all the relation determinations that belong to the sphere of reflection or of immediate being have lost their distinction, and what, like end, consequence, effect, and so on, is spoken of as an other, no longer has in purpose this determination of other, but is rather posited as identical with the simple concept.**

### 2. Product of teleological activity, external purposiveness, infinite progress (lines 214-378)

#### Product of teleological activity - External purposiveness (lines 214-233)
**Whole with respect to parts**: If we now examine the product of teleological activity more closely, we see that purpose comes to it only externally if we take it as an absolute presupposition over against a purpose which is subjective, that is to say, in so far as we stop short at a purposive activity that relates to the object through its means only mechanically, positing in place of one indifferent determinateness of the object an other which is just as external to it. A determinateness such as an object possesses through purpose differs in general from one which is merely mechanical in that it is a moment of a unity and consequently, although external to the object, is yet not in itself something merely external. The object that exhibits such a unity is a whole with respect to which its parts, its own externality, are indifferent; it is a determinate, concrete unity that unites different connections and determinacies within itself. This unity, which cannot be comprehended from the specific nature of the object and, as regards determinate content, is of another content than the object's own, is for itself not a mechanical determinateness, yet still is in the object mechanically.

#### External relations in syllogism, deficiency of formal syllogism (lines 246-276)
**Deficiency of formal syllogism**: Just as in this product of purposive activity the content of the purpose and the content of the object are external to each other, so too do the determinations in the other moments of the syllogism relate to each other externally, in the connecting middle, the purposive activity and the object which is the means; and in the subjective purpose, which is the other extreme, the infinite form as totality of the concept and the content of the concept. According to the connection by which the subjective purpose is syllogistically united with objectivity, both premises are an immediate connection, namely the connection of the object determined as middle term with the still external object, and the connection of the subjective purpose with the object made into means. The syllogism is therefore affected by the deficiency of the formal syllogism in general, namely that the connections in which it consists are not themselves conclusions or mediations but already presuppose the conclusion for the production of which they are supposed to serve as means.

#### Infinite progress of mediation (lines 278-318)
**Infinite progress**: If we consider the one premise, that of the immediate connection of the subjective purpose and the object that thereby becomes a means, then the purpose cannot connect with the object immediately, for the latter is just as immediate as the object of the other extreme in which the purpose is to be realized through mediation. Since the two are thus posited as diverse, a means for their connection must be interjected between this objectivity and the subjective purpose; but such a means is equally an object already determined by purpose, and between this objectivity and the teleological determination a new means is to be interjected, and so on to infinity. **The infinite progress of mediation is thereby set in motion.** The same happens as regards the other premise, the connection of the means with the yet indeterminate object. Since the two terms are utterly self-subsistent, they can be united only in a third, and so on to infinity. Or conversely, since the premises already presuppose the conclusion, the latter can only be imperfect, for it is based on those only immediate premises. The conclusion or the product of the purposive activity is nothing but an object determined by a purpose that is external to it; thus it is the same as what the means is. In such a product itself, therefore, only a means has been derived, not a realized purpose; or again: purpose has not truly attained any objectivity in it.

#### External purpose only means, objects perishable (lines 320-378)
**Perishable objects**: It is therefore entirely a matter of indifference whether we consider an object determined by external purpose as realized purpose or only as means; what we have is not an objective determination but a relative one, external to the object itself. All objects in which an external purpose is realized equally are, therefore, only a means of purpose. Anything which is intended for the realization of a purpose and is taken essentially as a means, is such a means by virtue of its vocation that it be used up. But also the object that is supposed to contain the realized purpose and show itself to be its objectivity is perishable; it likewise fulfills its purpose not by a tranquil, self-preserving existence, but only to the extent that it is worn out, for only to this extent does it conform to the unity of the concept, namely in so far as its externality, that is, its objectivity, sublates itself in that unity. A house, a clock, may appear as purposes with respect to the instruments employed in their production; but the stones, the cross-beams, or the wheels, the axles, and the rest that make up the actuality of the purpose, fulfill this purpose only through the pressure which they suffer, through the chemical processes to which they are exposed with air, light, and water, and from which they shield the human being; through their friction, and so on. They fulfill their vocation, therefore, only through their being used up and worn out, and only by virtue of their negation do they correspond to what they are supposed to be. They are not united with purpose positively, because they possess self-determination only externally and are only relative purposes, or essentially only means. These purposes thus in general have a restricted content; their form is the infinite self-determination of the concept, which through that content has restricted itself to external singularity. The restricted content renders these purposes inadequate to the infinity of the concept, relegating them to untruth; such a determinateness is through the sphere of necessity, through being, already at the mercy of becoming and alteration and passes away.

### 3. Inner purposive connection, objective purpose, realized purpose as identity (lines 380-607)

#### External purposiveness only means, purpose sunk into objectivity (lines 380-397)
**Purpose sunk into objectivity**: The result now is that external purposiveness, which only has so far the form of teleology, only goes so far as to be a means, not to be an objective purpose, because subjective purpose remains an external, subjective determination. Or in so far as purpose is active and attains completion, albeit only in a means, it is still bound up with objectivity immediately; it is sunk into it. Purpose is itself an object and, as one may say, it does not attain a means because its realization is needed before such a realization can be brought about through a means.

#### Inner purposive connection, objective purpose (lines 399-438)
**Immediate determination**: But the result is in fact not only an external purposive connection, but the truth of such a connection, inner purposive connection and an objective purpose. The self-subsistence of the object over against the concept that purpose presupposes is posited in this presupposition as an unessential reflective shine and as already sublated in and for itself; the activity of the purpose truly is, therefore, only the exposure of this reflective shine and the sublation of it. As the concept has demonstrated, the first object becomes by virtue of communication a means, for it implicitly is the totality of the concept, and its determinateness, which is none other than the externality itself, is posited as something only external and unessential, is posited in purpose itself, therefore, as the latter's own moment, not as anything that stands on its own over against it. As a result, the determination of the object as a means is altogether immediate. There is no need, therefore, for the subjective purpose to exercise any violence to make the object into a means, no need of extra reinforcement; the resolution, the resolve, this determination of itself, is the only posited externality of the object, which is therein immediately subjected to purpose, and has no other determination as against it than that of the nothingness of the being-in-and-for-itself.

#### Second sublation, realized purpose (lines 440-497)
**Realized purpose**: The second sublating of objectivity through objectivity differs from this first sublation in that the latter, being the first, is the purpose in objective immediacy; the second, therefore, is not only the sublating of a first immediacy but of both, of the objective as something merely posited and of the immediate. The negativity thus returns to itself in such a way that it is equally the restoration of objectivity, but of an objectivity which is identical with it, and in this it is at the same time also the positing of it as an external objectivity which is only determined by purpose. Because of this positing, the product remains as before also a means; because of the identity with negativity, the product is an objectivity which is identical with the concept, is the realized purpose in which the side of being a means is the reality itself of purpose. In the completed purpose the means disappears because it would be simply and solely the objectivity immediately subsumed under that purpose, an objectivity which in the realized purpose is the turning back of the purpose into itself; further, there also disappears with it mediation itself, as the relating of an external; it disappears into both the concrete identity of objective purpose, and into the same identity as abstract identity and immediacy of existence. Herein is also contained the mediation that was required for the first premise, the immediate connection of the purpose with the object. The realized purpose is also a means; conversely, the truth of the means is just this, to be the real purpose itself, and the first sublation of objectivity is already also the second, just as the second proved to contain the first also. For the concept determines itself, its determinateness is the external indifference which is immediately determined in the resolution as sublated, that is to say, as inner, subjective indifference and at the same time as presupposed object. Its further procession out of itself that appeared, namely as the immediate communication and subsumption of the presupposed object under it, is at one and the same time the sublating of that determinateness of externality which was internal, shut up in the concept, that is, posited as sublated, and the sublating of the presupposition of an object; consequently, this apparently first sublating of the indifferent objectivity is already the second as well, an immanent reflection that has gone through mediation, and the realized purpose.

#### Concept in reciprocal action, doubled movement (lines 499-562)
**Doubled movement**: Since the concept is here, in the sphere of objectivity where its determinateness has the form of indifferent externality, in reciprocal action with itself, the exposition of its movement becomes doubly difficult and intricate, for such a movement is itself immediately doubled and a first is always also a second. In the concept taken for itself, that is, in its subjectivity, the difference of itself from itself is as an immediate identical totality on its own; but since its determinateness here is indifferent externality, its self-identity is in this externality immediately also self-repulsion again, so that what is determined as external and indifferent to the identity is rather this identity itself, and the identity as identity, as self-reflected, is rather its other. Only by firmly attending to this shall we comprehend the objective turning back of the concept into itself, that is, its true objectification; only then shall we see that every one of the single moments through which this mediation runs its course is itself the whole syllogism of the mediation. Thus the original inner externality of the concept, by virtue of which the concept is self-repelling unity, purpose and the striving of purpose towards objectivity, is the immediate positing or the presupposition of an external object; the self-determination is also the determination of an external object not determined by the concept; and conversely this determination is self-determination, that is, the sublated externality posited as inner, or the certainty of the unessentiality of the external object. Of the second connection, that of the determination of the object as a means, we have just shown how it is within itself the self-mediation of purpose in the object. Likewise the third mode of connection, mechanism, which proceeds under the dominance of purpose and sublates the object by virtue of the object, is on the one hand the sublating of the means, of the object already posited as sublated, and consequently a second sublation and immanent reflection, and on the other hand a first determining of the external object. This last, as we remarked, is in the realized purpose again the production of only a means; the subjectivity of the finite concept, by contemptuously rejecting the means, has attained nothing better in its goal. But this reflection, namely that purpose is attained in the means and that the means and the mediation are preserved in the fulfilled purpose, is the final result of the external connection of purpose, a result in which this connection has sublated itself and which it has exhibited as its truth. The last considered third syllogism differs from the rest in that it is in the first instance the subjective purposive activity of the preceding syllogism, but also the sublation of external objectivity and consequently of externality in general; it is this through itself, and is, therefore, the totality in its positedness.

#### Concept as identity with immediate objectivity (lines 578-607)
**Identity with immediate objectivity**: We have now seen subjectivity, the being-for-itself of the concept, pass over into the concept's being-in-itself, into objectivity, and then the negativity of that being-for-itself reassert itself in objectivity; the concept has so determined itself in that negativity that its particularity is an external objectivity, or has determined itself as the simple concrete unity whose externality is its self-determination. **The movement of purpose has now attained this much, namely that the moment of externality is not just posited in the concept, the purpose is not just an ought and a striving, but as a concrete totality is identical with immediate objectivity.** This identity is on the one hand the simple concept, and the equally immediate objectivity, but, on the other hand, it is just as essentially mediation, and it is that simple immediacy only through this mediation sublating itself as mediation. Thus the concept is essentially this: to be distinguished, as an identity existing for itself, from its implicitly existent objectivity, and thereby to obtain externality, but in this external totality to be the totality's self-determining identity.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Mediation and Sublation**: Purpose in connection to means already reflected into itself. Objective immanent turning back not yet posited. Activity of purpose through means still directed against objectivity as initial presupposition. Activity is to be indifferent to determinateness. If again consisted in determining immediate objectivity, product would again be only means. So forth into infinity, only purposeful means would result. Not objectivity of purpose itself. In being active in means, purpose must not determine immediate object as external to it. Object must merge with it in unity of concept through itself. Otherwise external activity of purpose through means must determine itself as mediation. Thus sublate itself as external.

2. **Internal Transition**: Connection of activity of purpose with external object through means. First of all second premise of syllogism. Immediate connection of middle term with other extreme. Process in connection none other than mechanical or chemical. Previous relations come up again in objective externality. But under dominance of purpose. Processes return into purpose on their own. Mechanism occurring here at same time turning back of objectivity into itself. Into concept presupposed as purpose. Negative attitude of purposeful activity towards object not external attitude. **Objectivity's own alteration and internal transition into it**.

3. **Cunning of Reason**: Purpose immediately refers to object, makes it into means. Through means determines another object. May be regarded as violence. Purpose appears of entirely different nature than object. Two objects mutually independent totalities. Purpose posits itself in mediate connection with object. Between itself and object inserts another object. May be regarded as cunning of reason. Finitude of rationality has this side. Purpose relates to object as presupposition, external. In immediate connection purpose would enter sphere of mechanism and chemism. Subject to accidentality and loss of determining vocation. To be concept existing in and for itself. By sending object as means ahead, lets it do slavish work of externality. Abandons it to wear and tear while preserving itself behind it. Against mechanical violence.

4. **Tool and Power**: Purpose finite has finite content. Not rational absolutely, simply in and for itself. Means is external middle term of syllogism. Realization of purpose. In means rationality in purpose manifests itself as such. Maintaining itself in external other, precisely through externality. To this extent means higher than finite purposes of external purposiveness. Plough more honorable than immediately enjoyments it procures. Which are purposes. Tool lasts while immediate enjoyments pass away and forgotten. In tools human beings possess power over external nature. With respect to purposes subjected to it.

5. **Truth of Mechanism**: Purpose does not keep outside mechanical process. Keeps itself in it, is its determination. Purpose as concept concretely exists freely over against object and process. Self-determining activity. Equally truth of mechanism existing in and for itself. In latter only rejoins itself. Power of purpose over object is identity existing for itself. Activity is manifestation of this identity. Purpose as content is determinateness as exists in and for itself. Present in object as indifferent and external. Activity of purpose is truth of process on one side. As negative unity, sublation of reflective shine of externality. Indifferent determinateness of object one that abstractly replaced by another externally. Truth of simple abstraction of determinateness is totality of negative. Concrete concept positing externality within itself.

6. **End is Beginning**: Content of purpose is negativity as simple determinateness reflected into itself. Distinguished from totality as form. On account of simplicity, determinateness in and for itself totality of concept. Content appears as that which remains identical in realization. Teleological process is translation of concept concretely existing distinctly as concept into objectivity. Translation into presupposed other is rejoining of concept through itself with itself. Content of purpose now identity concretely existing in form of identical. In every transition concept maintains itself. When cause comes to effect, cause in effect only comes to itself. In teleological transition, what maintains itself is concept as such already concretely exists as cause. Free concrete unity as against objectivity and external determinateness. Externality into which purpose translates itself already posited as moment of concept. Form of inner differentiation. In externality purpose has own moment. Content as content of concrete unity is simple form. Does not remain in different moments only implicitly equal with itself. Also exists concretely as abidingly self-equal. **Of teleological activity: end is beginning, consequence ground, effect cause. Becoming of what has become. Only that which already concretely exists comes into existence. All relation determinations belonging to sphere of reflection or immediate being lost distinction. What spoken of as other no longer has determination of other. Posited as identical with simple concept.**

7. **External Purposiveness**: Examining product of teleological activity. Purpose comes to it only externally if taken as absolute presupposition. Over against purpose which is subjective. In so far as stop short at purposive activity relating to object through means only mechanically. Positing in place of one indifferent determinateness of object another external to it. Determinateness object possesses through purpose differs from merely mechanical. Is moment of unity, consequently although external to object. Yet not in itself something merely external. Object exhibiting such unity is whole with respect to which parts. Own externality are indifferent. Determinate, concrete unity uniting different connections and determinacies within itself. Unity cannot be comprehended from specific nature of object. As regards determinate content, of another content than object's own. For itself not mechanical determinateness, yet still in object mechanically.

8. **Infinite Progress**: Considering one premise: immediate connection of subjective purpose and object becoming means. Purpose cannot connect with object immediately. Latter just as immediate as object of other extreme. In which purpose realized through mediation. Since two posited as diverse, means for connection must be interjected. Between objectivity and subjective purpose. Such means equally object already determined by purpose. Between objectivity and teleological determination new means to be interjected. So on to infinity. **Infinite progress of mediation set in motion.** Same happens as regards other premise: connection of means with yet indeterminate object. Since two terms utterly self-subsistent, united only in third. So on to infinity. Conversely, since premises already presuppose conclusion. Latter can only be imperfect. Based on only immediate premises. Conclusion or product of purposive activity nothing but object determined by purpose external to it. Same as what means is. In such product only means derived, not realized purpose. Purpose not truly attained any objectivity in it.

9. **Perishable Objects**: Entirely matter of indifference whether consider object determined by external purpose as realized purpose or only means. Not objective determination but relative one, external to object itself. All objects in which external purpose realized equally only means of purpose. Anything intended for realization taken essentially as means. Such means by virtue of vocation that be used up. Object supposed to contain realized purpose and show itself as objectivity is perishable. Fulfills purpose not by tranquil, self-preserving existence. Only to extent worn out. Only to this extent conforms to unity of concept. In so far as externality, objectivity, sublates itself in unity. House, clock appear as purposes with respect to instruments employed. Stones, cross-beams, wheels, axles make up actuality of purpose. Fulfill purpose only through pressure suffered. Chemical processes exposed with air, light, water. Shield human being, friction. Fulfill vocation through being used up and worn out. Only by virtue of negation correspond to what supposed to be. Not united with purpose positively. Possess self-determination only externally. Only relative purposes, essentially only means. Purposes have restricted content. Form is infinite self-determination of concept. Through content restricted itself to external singularity. Restricted content renders purposes inadequate to infinity of concept. Relegating them to untruth. Determinateness through sphere of necessity, being, at mercy of becoming. Alteration and passes away.

10. **Inner Purposive Connection**: Result in fact not only external purposive connection. Truth of such connection: inner purposive connection and objective purpose. Self-subsistence of object over against concept purpose presupposes. Posited in presupposition as unessential reflective shine. Already sublated in and for itself. Activity of purpose truly only exposure of reflective shine and sublation. As concept demonstrated, first object becomes by virtue of communication means. Implicitly is totality of concept. Determinateness none other than externality itself. Posited as something only external and unessential. Posited in purpose itself as latter's own moment. Not anything standing on own over against it. Determination of object as means altogether immediate. No need for subjective purpose to exercise violence. Make object into means, no need of extra reinforcement. Resolution, resolve, determination of itself. Only posited externality of object. Immediately subjected to purpose. Has no other determination against it than nothingness of being-in-and-for-itself.

11. **Realized Purpose**: Second sublating of objectivity through objectivity differs from first. Latter being first is purpose in objective immediacy. Second not only sublating of first immediacy but of both. Objective as something merely posited and immediate. Negativity returns to itself in such way equally restoration of objectivity. But objectivity identical with it. In this at same time positing of it as external objectivity only determined by purpose. Because of positing, product remains as before also means. Because of identity with negativity, product is objectivity identical with concept. **Realized purpose in which side of being means is reality itself of purpose.** In completed purpose means disappears. Would be simply and solely objectivity immediately subsumed under purpose. Objectivity in realized purpose is turning back of purpose into itself. Mediation disappears with it. Relating of external disappears into concrete identity of objective purpose. Same identity as abstract identity and immediacy of existence. Mediation required for first premise: immediate connection of purpose with object. Realized purpose also means. Conversely truth of means just this: be real purpose itself. First sublation already also second. Second proved to contain first also. Concept determines itself, determinateness external indifference. Immediately determined in resolution as sublated. Inner, subjective indifference and at same time presupposed object. Further procession out of itself as immediate communication and subsumption. At one and same time sublating of determinateness of externality. Internal, shut up in concept, posited as sublated. Sublating of presupposition of object. Consequently apparently first sublating of indifferent objectivity already second as well. Immanent reflection gone through mediation, realized purpose.

12. **Doubled Movement**: Concept here in sphere of objectivity where determinateness has form of indifferent externality. In reciprocal action with itself. Exposition of movement doubly difficult and intricate. Movement itself immediately doubled, first always also second. In concept taken for itself, in subjectivity. Difference of itself from itself as immediate identical totality on own. Since determinateness here indifferent externality. Self-identity in externality immediately also self-repulsion again. What determined as external and indifferent to identity rather identity itself. Identity as identity, self-reflected, rather its other. Only by firmly attending to this comprehend objective turning back of concept into itself. True objectification. See that every single moment through which mediation runs course. Itself whole syllogism of mediation. Original inner externality of concept by virtue of which concept self-repelling unity. Purpose and striving towards objectivity is immediate positing or presupposition of external object. Self-determination also determination of external object not determined by concept. Conversely determination is self-determination. Sublated externality posited as inner, certainty of unessentiality of external object. Second connection: determination of object as means. Within itself self-mediation of purpose in object. Third mode: mechanism proceeding under dominance of purpose. Sublates object by virtue of object. On one hand sublating of means, object already posited as sublated. Consequently second sublation and immanent reflection. On other hand first determining of external object. Last as remarked in realized purpose again production of only means. Subjectivity of finite concept contemptuously rejecting means. Attained nothing better in goal. Reflection: purpose attained in means. Means and mediation preserved in fulfilled purpose. Final result of external connection of purpose. Result in which connection sublated itself. Exhibited as truth. Last considered third syllogism differs from rest. In first instance subjective purposive activity of preceding syllogism. Also sublation of external objectivity and externality in general. Through itself, totality in positedness.

13. **Identity with Immediate Objectivity**: Seen subjectivity, being-for-itself of concept, pass over into being-in-itself, objectivity. Negativity of being-for-itself reassert itself in objectivity. Concept determined itself in negativity that particularity is external objectivity. Determined itself as simple concrete unity whose externality is self-determination. **Movement of purpose attained: moment of externality not just posited in concept. Purpose not just ought and striving. As concrete totality identical with immediate objectivity.** Identity on one hand simple concept and equally immediate objectivity. On other hand just as essentially mediation. Simple immediacy only through mediation sublating itself as mediation. Concept essentially: distinguished as identity existing for itself. From implicitly existent objectivity. Obtain externality. In external totality be totality's self-determining identity.

8. **External Relations in Syllogism** (deficiency of formal syllogism)
9. **Infinite Progress of Mediation** (set in motion)
10. **External Purpose Only Means** (objects perishable, worn out)
11. **External Purposiveness Only Means** (purpose sunk into objectivity)
12. **Inner Purposive Connection** (objective purpose, immediate determination)
13. **Second Sublation** (realized purpose, means is reality itself of purpose)
14. **Concept in Reciprocal Action** (doubled movement, totality in positedness)
15. **Concept as Identity with Immediate Objectivity** (concrete totality identical with immediate objectivity)

## Transition Points

- **Means → Realized Purpose**: Purpose in connection to means, activity through means
- **External → Internal**: External purposiveness transitions to inner purposive connection
- **Infinite Progress → Inner Connection**: Infinite progress of mediation set in motion, but truth is inner purposive connection
- **Means → Realized Purpose**: Realized purpose in which side of being means is reality itself of purpose
- **Realized Purpose → Identity**: Concept as identity with immediate objectivity

## Related Concepts

- **Realized Purpose**: Completes Teleology and Objectivity
- **Mediation**: Purpose determines itself as mediation, sublate itself as external
- **Cunning of Reason**: Purpose posits itself in mediate connection, inserts another object
- **Tool**: Means higher than finite purposes, tool lasts
- **Truth of Mechanism**: Purpose keeps itself in mechanical process, is its determination
- **End is Beginning**: Teleological activity, becoming of what has become
- **External Purposiveness**: Purpose comes to product only externally
- **Infinite Progress**: Infinite progress of mediation set in motion
- **Perishable Objects**: Objects fulfill purpose only through being used up and worn out
- **Inner Purposive Connection**: Truth of external connection, objective purpose
- **Realized Purpose**: Side of being means is reality itself of purpose
- **Doubled Movement**: Movement immediately doubled, first always also second
- **Identity with Immediate Objectivity**: Concrete totality identical with immediate objectivity

## Notes for LO Generation

- Each chunk represents a complete logical thought
- TopicMap entries map directly to Chunk.id and LogicalOperation.label
- The structure follows three main sections: (1) Purpose in connection to means, (2) Product of teleological activity, (3) Inner purposive connection
- The key insight is that **the movement of purpose has now attained this much, namely that the moment of externality is not just posited in the concept, the purpose is not just an ought and a striving, but as a concrete totality is identical with immediate objectivity**
- The teleological process shows that **end is beginning, consequence ground, effect cause; becoming of what has become; only that which already concretely exists comes into existence**
- External purposiveness leads to infinite progress of mediation, but the truth is inner purposive connection and objective purpose
- Realized purpose: side of being means is reality itself of purpose
- Concept as identity with immediate objectivity: concrete totality identical with immediate objectivity
- This completes Teleology and Objectivity, prepares transition to Idea
