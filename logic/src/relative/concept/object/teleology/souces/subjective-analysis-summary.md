## Overview

The Subjective Purpose is the objective free concept, self-determining. In centrality and chemism, purpose is rediscovered. Purpose is rational in concrete existence, syllogism within. Purpose is finite, having objective world as presupposition. Movement of purpose: Sublating presupposition, realizing purpose. Purpose is exempt from transition—neither force expressing itself, nor substance/cause manifesting in accidents/effects. Purpose is the subjective concept as essential striving and impulse to posit itself externally.

## Structure

### Purpose rediscovered, exempt from transition (lines 2-50)
**Negative unity and objectivity**: In the centrality of the objective sphere, which is an indifference to determinateness, the subjective concept has first rediscovered and posited the negative point of unity, and in chemism it has first rediscovered and posited the objectivity of the determinations of the concept by which it is first posited as concrete objective concept. Its determinateness or its simple difference now has the determinateness of externality within it, and its simple unity is therefore the unity that repels itself from itself and in this repelling maintains itself. Purpose, therefore, is the subjective concept as an essential striving and impulse to posit itself externally. In this, it is exempt from transition. It is neither a force expressing itself, nor a substance or a cause manifesting itself in its accidents or effects. Purpose can of course also be defined as a force or a cause, but these expressions cover only an incomplete side of its signification; if they are to be said of purpose according to its truth, this can be done only in a way that sublates their concept, as a cause that solicits itself to expression, or a cause that is a cause of itself or whose effect is immediately the cause. When purposiveness is attributed to an intelligence, as was said above, this is done with specific reference to a certain content. But, as such, purpose is to be taken as the rational in its concrete existence. It manifests rationality by being the concrete concept that holds the objective difference in its absolute unity.

### Purpose as syllogism within, self-equal universal (lines 51-73)
**Self-repelling negativity**: Within, therefore, it is essentially syllogism. It is the self-equal universal; more precisely, inasmuch as it contains self-repelling negativity, it is universal though at first still indeterminate activity. But since this activity is negative self-reference, it determines itself immediately and gives itself the moment of particularity, and this particularity, as likewise the totality of the form reflected into itself, is content as against the posited differences of the form. The same negativity, through its self-reference, is just as immediately the reflection of the form into itself and singularity. From the one side, this reflection is the inner universality of the subject; from the other side, however, it is outwards reflection; and to this extent purpose is still something subjective, its activity still directed to an external objectivity.

### Purpose as concept come to itself, finitude (lines 75-119)
**Extra-mundane concrete existence**: For purpose is the concept that has come to itself in objectivity; the determinateness that it has given itself there is that of objective indifference and externality of determinateness; its self-repelling negativity is therefore one whose moments, being only determinations of the concept itself, also have the form of objective indifference to one another. Already in the formal judgment are subject and predicate determined as self-subsistent over against each other; but their self-subsistence is still only abstract universality. It has now attained the determination of objectivity, but, as a moment of the concept, this complete difference is enclosed within the simple unity of the concept. Now in so far as purpose is this total reflection of objectivity into itself and is such immediately, in the first place, the self-determination or the particularity as simple reflection into itself is distinguished from the concrete form, and is a determinate content. Accordingly, purpose is finite, even though according to form it is equally infinite subjectivity. Secondly, since its determinateness has the form of objective indifference, it has the shape of a presupposition, and from this side its finitude consists in its having before it an objective, mechanical and chemical world to which its activity is directed as to something already there; its self-determining activity is in its identity thus immediately external to itself, reflection into itself just as much as reflection outwards. To this extent purpose still has a truly extra-mundane concrete existence; to the extent, namely, that this objectivity stands opposed to it, just as the latter, as a mechanical and chemical whole still not determined and not pervaded by purpose, stands on its side opposed to it.

### Movement of purpose - Realization (lines 121-164)
**Impulse to realization**: Consequently, the movement of purpose can now be expressed as being directed at sublating its presupposition, that is, the immediacy of the object, and at positing it as determined by the concept. This negative relating to the object is equally a negative attitude towards itself, a sublating of the subjectivity of purpose. Positively, this is the realization of purpose, namely the unification of the objective being with it, so that this being, which as a moment of purpose is immediately the determinateness identical with it, shall be as external determinateness, and conversely the objective, as presupposition, shall be posited rather as determined by the concept. Purpose is in it the impulse to its realization; the determinateness of the moments of the concept is externality; the simplicity of these moments within the unity of the concept is however incommensurable with what this unity is, and the concept therefore repels itself from itself. This repulsion is in general the resolution of the self-reference of the negative unity by virtue of which the latter is exclusive singularity; but by this excluding the unity resolves itself, that is to say, it discloses itself, for it is self-determination, the positing of itself. On the one hand, in determining itself, subjectivity makes itself into particularity, gives itself a content which, enclosed within the unity of the concept, is still an inner content; but this positing, the simple reflection into itself, is, as we have seen, at the same time immediately a presupposing; and at the same moment in which the subject of purpose determines itself, it is referred to an indifferent, external objectivity which is to be made equal by it with the determinateness of that inner content, that is to say, posited as something determined by the concept, first of all as means.

## Key Philosophical Insights

1. **Purpose Rediscovered**: In centrality of objective sphere, subjective concept rediscovered negative point of unity. In chemism rediscovered objectivity of determinations of concept. First posited as concrete objective concept.

2. **Exempt from Transition**: Purpose is exempt from transition. Neither force expressing itself, nor substance/cause manifesting in accidents/effects. Force has not expressed itself is abstract inner, first has existence in externalization. Same applies to cause and substance. Have actuality only in accidents and effects, activity is transition. Do not maintain themselves in freedom.

3. **Rational in Concrete Existence**: Purpose as such is rational in concrete existence. Manifests rationality by being concrete concept holding objective difference in absolute unity.

4. **Syllogism Within**: Within purpose essentially syllogism. Self-equal universal. Contains self-repelling negativity. Universal though at first still indeterminate activity. Since activity is negative self-reference, determines itself immediately. Gives itself moment of particularity.

5. **Finitude**: Purpose is finite, even though according to form equally infinite subjectivity. Determinateness has form of objective indifference, shape of presupposition. Finitude consists in having before it objective, mechanical and chemical world. Activity directed as to something already there.

6. **Extra-Mundane Concrete Existence**: Purpose has truly extra-mundane concrete existence. Objectivity stands opposed to it. Mechanical and chemical whole still not determined and not pervaded by purpose. Stands on its side opposed to it.

7. **Movement of Purpose**: Movement of purpose directed at sublating presupposition. Immediacy of object. Positing it as determined by concept. Negative relating to object equally negative attitude towards itself. Sublating subjectivity of purpose. Positively, realization of purpose.

8. **Impulse to Realization**: Purpose is impulse to its realization. Determinateness of moments of concept is externality. Simplicity of moments within unity incommensurable with what unity is. Concept repels itself from itself. Repulsion is resolution of self-reference of negative unity. By excluding unity resolves itself, discloses itself. Is self-determination, positing of itself.

9. **Means**: In determining itself, subjectivity makes itself into particularity. Gives itself content enclosed within unity of concept. Still inner content. Positing, simple reflection into itself, at same time immediately presupposing. At same moment subject of purpose determines itself. Referred to indifferent, external objectivity. To be made equal by it with determinateness of inner content. Posited as something determined by concept, first of all as means.
