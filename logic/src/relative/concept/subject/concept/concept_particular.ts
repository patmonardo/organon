Determinateness as such belongs to being and the qualitative;
as the determinateness of the concept, it is particularity.
It is not a limit, as if it were related to an other beyond it,

in particularity, therefore, the universal is not
in an other but simply and solely with itself.`,

The particular has one and the same universality as
the other particulars to which it is related.
The diversity of these particulars,
because of their identity with the universal, is
as such at the same time universal;
it is totality.
The particular, therefore,
does not only contain the universal
but exhibits it also through its determinateness;
accordingly the universal constitutes a sphere
that the particular must exhaust.
This totality, inasmuch as the determinateness
of the particular is taken as mere diversity,

the determinateness is its difference;
it is only differentiated from itself.
Its species are therefore
only (a) the universal itself

The universal is as concept itself and its opposite,

Both, as particular, are also
determinate as against the universal,

But even this universal,
as against which the particular is determined,
is for that reason itself also
just one of the opposing sides.
When we speak of two opposing sides,
we must repeat that the two constitute the particular,
not just together, as if they were alike

at the same time essentially only one determinateness;
it is the negativity which in the universal is simple.`,

posited as referring essentially to its other;

thus begins to be posited;
at first, however, the unity is only
a reflective shine in an other.
The true significance of the transitoriness

that they attain to their concept, to their truth;
being, existence, something,

substance and accidents, cause and effect,
are thought determinations on their own;
as determinate concepts, however,
they are grasped in so far as each
is cognized in unity with its others

Whole and parts, for example,
or cause and effect, and so on,
are not yet diverse terms
that are determined as particular
relatively to each other,

their unity has not yet attained the form of universality;
thus the difference as well which is in these relations,
does not yet have the form of being one determinateness.
Cause and effect, for example, are not two diverse concepts
but only one determinate concept,
and causality is, like every concept,
a simple concept.`,

we have just seen that the determinate moment
of  particularity is complete in the difference

To be sure, there are more than two species
to be found in any genus in nature,
and these many species cannot stand
in the same relation to each other
as we have shown.
This is the impotence of nature,
that it cannot abide by and exhibit the rigor of the concept
and loses itself in a blind manifoldness void of concept.
We can wonder at nature,
at the manifoldness of its genera and species,
in the infinite diversity of its shapes,
for wonder is without concept
and its object is the irrational.
It is allowed to nature,
since nature is the self-externality of the concept,
to indulge in this diversity,
just as spirit, even though it possesses
the concept in the shape of concept,
lets itself go into pictorial representation
and runs wild in the infinite manifoldness of the latter.
The manifold genera and species of nature must not be
esteemed to be anything more than arbitrary notions of spirit
engaged in pictorial representations.
Both indeed show traces and intimations of the concept,
but they do not exhibit it in trustworthy copy,
for they are the sides of its free self-externality;
the concept is the absolute power precisely
because it can let its difference go free
in the shape of self-subsistent diversity,
external necessity, accidentality, arbitrariness, opinion;
all of which, however, must not be taken as anything
more than the abstract side of nothingness.`,

    text: `As we have just seen, the determinateness of
the particular is simple as principle,
but it is also simple as a moment of the totality,
determinateness as against the other determinateness.
The concept, in determining or differentiating itself,
behaves negatively towards its unity
and gives itself the form of one
of its ideal moments of being;
as a determinate concept,
it has a determinate existence in general.
But this being no longer has
the significance of mere immediacy,
but has the significance rather of an immediacy
which is equal to itself by virtue of absolute mediation,
an immediacy that equally contains in itself
the other moment of essence or of reflection.
This universality, with which the determinate clothes itself,
is abstract universality.
The particular has this universality in it as its essence;
but in so far as the determinateness
of the difference is posited
and thereby has being,
the universality is form in it,
and the determinateness as such is its content.
Universality becomes form inasmuch as
the difference is something essential,
just as in the pure universal it is, on the contrary,
only absolute negativity
and not a difference posited as such.`,

as against the other determinateness;
but the other determinateness is only universality itself,
and this too is therefore abstract universality;
and the determinateness of the concept, or particularity,
is again nothing more than determinate universality.
In this universality, the concept is outside itself,
and because it is it, the concept,
which is there outside itself,
the abstract-universal contains
all the moments of the concept.
It is
(a) universality,
(b) determinateness,
(c) the simple unity of the two;
but this unity is immediate,
and the particularity is not
therefore as totality.
Implicitly it is this totality also, and mediation;
it is essentially a reference to the other excluding it,
or the sublation of negation,
namely of the other determinateness
an other that lingers on only as an intention,
for it vanishes immediately revealing itself to be
the same as its other is supposed to be.
Therefore, what makes this universality an abstraction
is that the mediation is only a condition,
or is not posited in it.
Because it is not posited,
the unity of the abstraction has the form of immediacy,
and the content has the form of indifference to its universality,
for the content is nothing but this totality
which is the universality of absolute negativity.
Hence the abstract universal is indeed the concept,
but the unconceptualized concept,
the concept not posited as such.`,

    text: `When we speak of the determinate concept,
what we ordinarily mean is
precisely just this abstract universal.
Even by concept as such,
what is generally understood is
only this unconceptualized concept,
and the understanding is designated as its faculty.
Demonstration belongs to this understanding
inasmuch as it proceeds by way of concepts,
that is to say, only in determinations.
This progression by way of concepts does not therefore
reach past finitude and necessity;
the highest it reaches is the negative infinite,
the abstraction of the highest essence
which is itself the determinateness
of the indeterminateness.
Absolute substance, too, although not this empty abstraction
but on the contrary a totality according to content,
is still abstract, for since it is without absolute form,
its innermost truth is not constituted by the concept;
although it is the identity of universality and particularity,
or of thought and externality,
this identity is not the determinateness of the concept;
there is rather an understanding outside it,
an understanding which is contingent precisely
because it is outside it in which and for which
substance exists in diverse attributes and modes.
Moreover, abstraction is not as empty as
it is usually said to be;
it is the determinate concept;
it has some determinateness or other for its content;
the highest essence also, the pure abstraction,
has the determinateness of indeterminateness,
as just mentioned;
but indeterminateness is a determinateness
because it is supposed to stand opposite the determinate.
But the moment one says what it is,
its intended meaning sublates itself by itself;
for it is spoken of on a par with determinateness,
and from this abstraction the concept and its truth are brought out.`,
