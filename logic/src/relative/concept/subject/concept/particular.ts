/**
 * THE PARTICULAR CONCEPT: VRITTI as Five-fold Specification of Universal CITTA
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * The Particular as the second moment of the Qualitative Syllogism,
 * representing VRITTI (mental modifications) as the five-fold specification
 * of the three-fold universal CITTA. This reveals why CITTA-VRITTI-NIRODHA
 * has the structure it does: 3-fold Universal → 5-fold Particular → Singular unity.
 *
 * The CITTA-VRITTI Correspondence:
 * - CITTA (3-fold): BUDDHI-AHAMKARA-MANAS as universal principle
 * - VRITTI (5-fold): PRAMANA-VIPARYAYA-VIKALPA-NIDRA-SMRITI as particular determinations
 * - The five VRITTIS correspond to PANCHA-VISHAYA (five objects)
 * - Each VRITTI is a particular determination of universal consciousness
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - VISESHA: Particular specification of universal consciousness
 * - VRITTI: Mental modification as particular determination
 * - GUNA-VISESHA: Qualified particular as universal's self-manifestation
 * - PANCHA-VRITTI: Five-fold modification structure
 * - VISHAYA-VRITTI: Object-modification correlation
 *
 * "The particular is the universal itself, but it is its difference
 * or reference to an other" - Hegel
