/**
 * THE SINGULAR CONCEPT: VRITTI-NIRODHA as Absolute Enclosure and Scientific Singularity
 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * The Singular as the third moment of the Qualitative Syllogism,
 * representing the absolute return of the concept into itself through
 * complete determination. This is VRITTI-NIRODHA as the singular point
 * where universal CITTA achieves perfect self-enclosure through the
 * complete exhaustion of particular VRITTI-determinations.
 *
 * The Science-Singularity Connection:
 * - Each Science as Universal-Particular-Singular totality
 * - Singular as "point of Enclosure" where mind places itself in subgraph
 * - When experiencing "Cat" = entering Cat-universe as singular totality
 * - Scientific knowledge as ability to project from singular enclosures
 * - The mystery of how infinite universal becomes present in finite particular
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - VRITTI-NIRODHA: Complete cessation as singular achievement
 * - KAIVALYA: Absolute isolation as singular self-enclosure
 * - EKAGRATA: One-pointed concentration as singular focus
 * - SAMADHI-VISHAYA: Object of concentration as singular totality
 * - PURUSHA-SVARUPA: Individual consciousness in essential nature

    - Surface-level thinking
    - "Consciousness in general" as void abstraction
    - NIRGUNA-BRAHMAN misunderstood as empty universal

    True Singularity (PARA-VIDYA):
    - Descending to richest concrete determination
    - Exhausting all content without losing it
    - Depth-level realization
    - THIS consciousness as absolute singularity
    - SAGUNA-BRAHMAN as concrete universal

    The Yogic Distinction:
    - BAHIRANGA-SADHANA: External practices (abstract universal)
    - ANTARANGA-SADHANA: Internal practices (concrete singular)
    - SAMADHI-GAMBHIRYA: Depth of concentration vs surface meditation
    - True NIRVIKALPA as richest, not emptiest state

    Why "Life, Spirit, God" Beyond Abstraction:
    - All living realities are essentially singular-universal
    - Abstract universality cannot grasp individual personality
    - ISHVARA as singular-universal, not abstract absolute
    - The necessity of devotional (BHAKTI) approaches

    This resolves the eternal philosophical debate about abstract vs concrete!

    The Holographic Structure of Conceptual Reality:

    Universal Contains All:
    - Universal CITTA contains particular VRITTI and singular NIRODHA
    - Not external container but internal essence
    - SARVABHUTANTARATMAN: Inner self of all beings

    Particular Contains All:
    - Each VRITTI contains universal consciousness and singular achievement
    - PRAMANA contains VIPARYAYA and NIRODHA within itself
    - SARVA-VRITTI-YOGA: Unity of all modifications

    Singular Contains All:
    - Each individual NIRODHA contains universal principles and particular methods
    - THIS realization containing ALL possible realizations
    - KAIVALYA as singular-universal totality

    The Scientific Parallel:
    - Each mathematical theorem containing whole mathematical universe
    - Each physical experiment revealing universal laws
    - Each biological species containing evolutionary totality
    - SARVA-SHASTRA-UNITY: Unity of all sciences in each science

    Why Rigid Distinctions Fail:
    - Living thought transcends artificial separations
    - PRATYABHIJNA: Recognition dissolving apparent differences
    - Each moment passing into its others when truly understood
    - The systematic inter-relatedness of all genuine knowledge

    This is the SECRET of holistic understanding!

    THE MYSTERY OF STEPPING INTO ACTUALITY:

    "Through singularity, where it is internal to itself,
    the concept becomes external to itself and steps into actuality"

    The Great Transition:
    - Pure concept must become actual existence
    - Internal completion necessitating external manifestation
    - ABHIVYAKTI: Manifestation as concept's self-externalization

    In Yogic Terms:
    - CAITANYA (pure consciousness) becoming JIVA (individual soul)
    - NIRGUNA (attribute-less) becoming SAGUNA (with attributes)
    - UNMANIFEST becoming MANIFEST while remaining unmanifest

    The Scientific Mystery:
    - Mathematical truth becoming physical reality
    - Logical possibility becoming actual existence
    - Theoretical knowledge becoming practical application
    - SIDDHANTA-PRAYOGA: Principle becoming practice

    The Individual Mystery:
    - Universal consciousness becoming THIS individual consciousness
    - Infinite becoming finite while remaining infinite
    - The unrepeatable uniqueness of each singular existence
    - Why no two individuals identical despite shared universality

    The Creative Mystery:
    - How one becomes many while remaining one
    - BRAHMA-RACHANA: Divine creativity through self-partition
    - Each individual as unique creative expression of universal
    - The endless creativity of consciousness knowing itself

    This is the ULTIMATE MYSTERY of existence itself!
