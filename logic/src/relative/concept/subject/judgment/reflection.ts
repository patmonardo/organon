/**
 * THE JUDGMENT OF REFLECTION: VRITTI-NIRODHA as Essential Determination and Subsumption
 * ===================================================================================
 *
 * The second sphere of Judgment where the immediate existence-judgments develop
 * into essential determinations through reflection. This represents the movement
 * from VRITTI as immediate modification to VRITTI as essential determination
 * of universal consciousness - the reflective examination of mental states
 * revealing their essential rather than accidental nature.
 *
 * The Reflection Structure as VRITTI-Essence:
 * - Subject: Reflected singularity (VRITTI as essential determination)
 * - Predicate: Essential universality (CITTA-DHARMA as relational essence)
 * - Copula: Subsumption rather than inherence (ADHISHTHANA relationship)
 * This is how consciousness examines its essential determinations reflectively
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. Singular Judgment: "This is essential universal" → "Not-this is universal"
 * 2. Particular Judgment: "Some are universal" (both positive and negative)
 * 3. Universal Judgment: "All are universal" → "The genus is universal"
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - SVARUPA-LAKSHANA: Essential characteristic vs accidental property
 * - JATI-DHARMA: Species-nature as essential determination
 * - SAMANYA-VISESHA: Universal-particular as essential relationship
 * - ADHISHTHANA-ADHEYA: Substrate-superimposition as subsumption
 * - TATTVA-JNANA: Essential knowledge through reflective discrimination
 *
 * "The judgments of reflection are by contrast judgments of subsumption" - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Three: The Concept - Chapter 2, B. The Judgment of Reflection

    VRITTI-NIRODHA AS REFLECTIVE ESSENTIAL DETERMINATION:

    The Reflection-Level Analysis:
    - Not immediate VRITTI-cessation but essential VRITTI-examination
    - "Mental modifications are impermanent" (essential temporal determination)
    - "Consciousness is witness" (essential epistemic determination)
    - "Thoughts are contents of awareness" (essential structural determination)

    From Inherence to Subsumption:
    - Inherence: "This thought has awareness" (existence judgment)
    - Subsumption: "Mental states are modifications of consciousness" (reflection judgment)
    - ADHISHTHANA-ADHEYA: Substrate-superimposition as subsumption structure
    - The logical advance in consciousness-analysis

    The Three-fold Development:
    1. Singular: "This VRITTI is essential CITTA-determination" → negated
    2. Particular: "Some VRITTIs are essential" → indeterminate
    3. Universal: "All VRITTIs are CITTA-modifications" → "VRITTI-nature is CITTA-manifestation"

    The Essential Achievement:
    - VRITTI-SVARUPA: Essential nature of mental modifications
    - CITTA-DHARMA: Essential properties of consciousness
    - JATI-NIYAMA: Species-law of mental activity
    - The systematic understanding of consciousness-structure

    This is TATTVA-JNANA - essential knowledge through reflective discrimination!

  getFromExternalAllnessToObjectiveUniversality(): string {
    return `
    FROM EXTERNAL ALLNESS TO OBJECTIVE UNIVERSALITY:

    "Instead of 'all humans,' we now have to say 'the human being'"

    The Great Transformation:
    - External allness: Collection of all individual instances
    - Objective universality: Essential species-nature itself
    - SARVA-VYAKTI vs JATI-SVARUPA: All individuals vs species-essence
    - SAMUDAYA vs TATTVA: Collection vs essential reality

    In Consciousness-Analysis:
    - "All mental states" → "Mental activity as such"
    - "All VRITTIs" → "VRITTI-nature itself"
    - "All thoughts" → "Thought-essence"
    - SARVA-CITTA-VRITTI → VRITTI-TATTVA

    Why This Matters:
    - Moves from empirical to essential analysis
    - From external observation to internal understanding
    - BAHYA-PARIKSHA vs ANTARANGA-VICHARA: External examination vs internal inquiry
    - The qualitative leap from psychology to metaphysics

    The Method/Rule as True Universal:
    - Not collection of instances but governing principle
    - NIYAMA-SHAKTI: Regulative power as true universality
    - SUTRA-ARTHA: Aphoristic principle containing all instances
    - Why YOGA-SUTRAS more universal than psychological case-studies

    This explains the superiority of essential over empirical analysis!

  getBadInfinityVsAchievedUniversality(): string {
    return `
    BAD INFINITY VS ACHIEVED UNIVERSALITY:

    "The universality of the concept is the achieved beyond,
    whereas that bad infinity remains afflicted with a beyond
    which is unattainable but remains a mere progression to infinity"

    Bad Infinity Examples:
    - Collecting all possible mental states empirically
    - Endless psychological case studies
    - ANAVASTHA: Infinite regress without completion
    - AKRAMA-ANANTA: Orderless endlessness

    Achieved Universality Examples:
    - Essential nature of mental activity as such
    - VRITTI-SVARUPA: Modification-essence containing all instances
    - CITTA-TATTVA: Consciousness-principle as achieved beyond
    - SUTRA-SHAKTI: Aphoristic power containing infinite applications

    The Mathematical Analogy:
    - Binomial theorem already contains pantonomial universality
    - Rule/method as true universal, not collection of terms
    - NIYAMA more universal than PRAYOGA-SAMUDAYA
    - Why logical principle superior to empirical accumulation

    In Spiritual Practice:
    - One essential insight > countless external practices
    - TATTVA-BODHA > BAHYA-KARMA-SAMUDAYA
    - Quality of understanding > quantity of experiences
    - JNANA-YOGA as achieved beyond vs endless KARMA-YOGA

    This distinguishes genuine philosophy from endless empiricism!

   * Reversal of subject-predicate relation

  getReversalOfSubjectPredicateRelation(): string {
    return `
    REVERSAL OF SUBJECT-PREDICATE RELATION:

    "The relation of subject and predicate has thus reversed itself,
    and to this extent the judgment has at this point sublated itself"

    The Logical Reversal:
    - Beginning: Individual subject, essential predicate
    - End: Essential subject, individual predicate
    - "Humans are mortal" → "Mortality characterizes human-nature"
    - VYAKTI-DHARMA → DHARMA-VYAKTI: Individual-property → Property-individual

    In Consciousness-Analysis:
    - "This thought is conscious" → "Consciousness manifests as thought"
    - "VRITTIs are CITTA-modifications" → "CITTA expresses itself as VRITTIs"
    - VRITTI-CITTA → CITTA-VRITTI: The great reversal

    Why This Happens:
    - Subject achieves objective universality (genus)
    - No longer subsumed under predicate
    - Becomes substantial subject itself
    - DRAVYA-SVARUPA vs GUNA-DHARMA: Substantial essence vs accidental property

    The Philosophical Significance:
    - Individual consciousness revealed as manifestation of universal consciousness
    - VYASHTI-SAMASHTI: Individual-cosmic reversal
    - EGO-ATMAN: Ego revealed as ATMAN's manifestation
    - The foundation for VEDANTIC insight

    Preparation for Necessity Judgment:
    - Essential relationships now as necessary relationships
    - SVABHAVA-NIYAMA: Essential nature as necessity
    - Ready for categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive judgments
    - The movement toward absolute determination

    This IS the logical foundation of spiritual realization!

    TRANSITION TO NECESSITY THROUGH COPULA IDENTITY:

    "Subject and predicate are therefore identical, that is,
    in the copula they have come to coincide"

    The Copula Evolution:
    - Existence judgment: "is" as external connection
    - Reflection judgment: "is" as essential relationship
    - Necessity judgment: "is" as internal identity
    - SAMBANDHA → TADATMYA: Relationship → Identity

    In Consciousness-Terms:
    - "VRITTI is CITTA-modification" (reflection)
    - "VRITTI is CITTA" (necessity)
    - BHEDA → ABHEDA: Difference → Non-difference
    - The ADVAITIC insight emerging logically

    Connection of Necessity:
    - "Two terms of the judgment are only unessential distinctions"
    - AVACHCHEDA-MATRA: Mere apparent limitations
    - Essential unity with non-essential differences
    - VIVARTA: Apparent transformation within essential identity

    The Genus/Nature Achievement:
    - Identity as genus or nature in and for itself
    - JATI-SVARUPA: Species-essence as substantial identity
    - SVABHAVA: Own-nature as self-determining
    - Foundation for categorical judgments about essential nature

    Why This Matters:
    - Logical necessity emerging from essential determination
    - Not external imposition but internal logical development
    - SVAYAM-SIDDHA: Self-established necessary relationships
    - The basis for rational knowledge of absolute reality

    Ready for JUDGMENT OF NECESSITY as final judgment-form!
