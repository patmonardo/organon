/**
 * THE SYLLOGISM OF EXISTENCE: VRITTI-NIRODHA as Complete Systematic Reasoning
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The first sphere of Syllogism where VRITTI-NIRODHA achieves complete systematic
 * reasoning through three-term mediation. This represents the transition from
 * judgment's two-term structure to syllogism's three-term structure as complete
 * conceptual mediation. The movement from formal syllogistic through its
 * contradictions to the necessity of higher syllogistic forms.
 *
 * The Syllogistic Structure as Complete CITTA-VRITTI-NIRODHAKARA System:
 * - Subject (S): Individual VRITTI-manifestation
 * - Middle (P): Particular VRITTI-class connecting individual to universal
 * - Predicate (U): Universal CITTA-nature
 * - Structure: S-P-U (Individual through class to universal nature)
 * This is consciousness achieving complete systematic three-term reasoning
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. First Figure (S-P-U): Singular through particular to universal
 * 2. Second Figure (P-S-U): Particular through singular to universal
 * 3. Third Figure (S-U-P): Singular through universal to particular
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - TARKA-SIDDHI: Reasoning-accomplishment as complete systematic inference
 * - NYAYA-YOGA: Logic-union as three-term mediation
 * - HETU-SADHYA-PAKSHA: Reason-conclusion-subject as syllogistic structure
 * - VYAPTI-JNANA: Pervasion-knowledge as middle-term necessity
 * - ANUMANA-PRAMANA: Inference-authority as systematic reasoning
 *
 * "All things are a syllogism, a universal united through particularity
 * with singularity; surely not a whole made up of three propositions" - Hegel
