/**
 * THE SYLLOGISM OF NECESSITY: ANIVARYATA-TARKA as Absolute Objective Reasoning
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The third and final sphere of Syllogism where ANIVARYATA-TARKA achieves absolute
 * objective reasoning through necessary connection. This represents the culmination
 * of the entire Subjective Logic as the Concept realizes itself through complete
 * syllogistic development into Objectivity.
 *
 * The Necessary Structure as Complete NITYA-SVATANTRA-AIKYA System:
 * - Middle: Objective universality containing whole determinateness of extremes
 * - Unity: Completed but simple universality (universal nature of fact, genus)
 * - Content: Full content through immanent reflection of extreme determinateness
 * - Form: External and unessential (terms as moments of necessary existence)
 * This is consciousness achieving absolute objective reasoning through necessity
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. Categorical Syllogism: Substantial identity through objective universality
 * 2. Hypothetical Syllogism: Necessary connection through form/negative unity
 * 3. Disjunctive Syllogism: Totality as developed objective universality
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - ANIVARYATA-TARKA: Necessity-reasoning as absolute systematic inference
 * - SVARUPA-MADHYAMA: Essential-nature middle vs adventitious content
 * - NITYATVA-SAMBANDHA: Eternal connection vs contingent relation
 * - PURNA-VYAPTI: Complete pervasion as objective universality
 * - SVATANTRA-PARIPURNA: Independent completeness as realized concept
 *
 * "This syllogism is for this reason the syllogism of necessity, because its middle
 * term is not any adventitious immediate content but is the immanent reflection
 * of the determinateness of the extremes" - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Three: The Concept - Chapter 3, C. The Syllogism of Necessity

    - Extremes as distinct from middle = only positedness
    - MATRA-STHAPANA: Mere positedness vs proper determinateness
    - No proper determinateness accruing to extremes against middle
    - Distinction of mediating and mediated has fallen away

    The Complete Achievement:
    - That which is mediated = essential moment of what mediates it
    - Each moment = totality of what is mediated
    - SARVA-MADHYA-MADHYATA: All-mediating-mediated identity
    - Mediating factor as concept's totality (not abstract determination)
    - Different genera showing stages of middle term's repletion/concretion

    The Syllogistic Development Summary:
    - Formal: Middle as totality through all determinacies separately
    - Reflection: Middle as external gathering unity
    - Necessity: Middle as developed and total yet simple unity
    - AKRAMA-PRATIBIMBA-ANIVARYATA: Formal-reflection-necessity progression
    - Form of syllogism (difference of middle from extremes) sublated

    RESULT: CONCEPT REALIZED AS OBJECTIVITY!
    "With this the concept in general has been realized; more precisely,
    it has gained the kind of reality which is objectivity"

    THE COMPLETE REALIZATION OF CONCEPT:

    The First Reality (Judgment and Syllogism):
    - Concept as negative unity partitions itself
    - Judgment: posits determinations in determinate indifferent difference
    - Syllogism: sets itself over against them as inwardness
    - VIBHAGA-VIPAKSHA: Partition-opposition as first reality
    - Still inwardness of acquired externality

    The Course of Syllogisms:
    - Externality equated with inner unity through mediation
    - Different determinations return into unity through third term
    - MADHYAMA-AIKYAGAMANA: Middle-unity-return as systematic process
    - Externality exhibits concept in itself
    - Concept no longer distinct as inner unity

    The Final Identity:
    - Identity of concept's inwardness and externality
    - Not only result but truth throughout (even in judgment)
    - ANTAH-BAHYA-ABHEDA: Inner-outer non-difference as final truth
    - Moments remain connected even in reciprocal indifference
    - Significance only in connection, not isolation

    THE COMPLETE MEDIATION SUBLATION:
    - Mediation = complete concept in its positedness
    - Movement = sublation of mediation (nothing in and for itself)
    - MADHYAMA-NIRAKARANA: Mediation sublation as final achievement
    - Each thing only through mediation of other
    - Result = immediacy through sublation of mediation

    The Necessity Achievement:

    - Not adventitious content but essential nature reflection
    - SVARUPA-PRATIBIMBA: Essential-nature reflection vs external content
    - Terms as moments of necessary existence
    - Complete objectivity through necessary connection

    The Three-fold Necessity Development:
    1. Categorical: Substantial identity through objective universality
    2. Hypothetical: Necessary connection through form/negative unity
    3. Disjunctive: Totality as developed objective universality
    - VASTU-KALPANA-VIKALPA: Substantial-hypothetical-disjunctive as absolute reasoning
    - Each pointing beyond formal syllogistic to objective reasoning

    The Absolute Reasoning Achievement:
    - Not formal manipulation but absolute objective reasoning
    - PURNA-VASTU-TARKA: Complete object-reasoning vs subjective approach
    - Immanent reflection through necessary connection
    - Concept achieving complete self-determination
    - Transition from Subjective Logic to Objective Logic

    - Being = equally identical with mediation
    - VASTU-SVATAH-SIDDHA: Object in and for itself as complete achievement
    - Concept restored itself out of and in its otherness
    - Immediacy emerged through sublation of mediation

    The Systematic Achievement:
    - Subjectivity of syllogism and concept sublated
    - Formalism of syllogistic inference overcome
    - RUPA-VYAVAHARIKA-NIRAKARANA: Form-practical sublation
    - Distinction of mediating and mediated fallen away
    - Each moment = totality of what is mediated

    The Three Stages Summary:
    - Existence: Abstract particularity as middle (formal)
    - Reflection: Totality of determinations as middle (concrete)
    - Necessity: Immanent reflection as middle (absolute)
    - SAKSHAD-PRATIBIMBA-ANIVARYATA: Immediate-reflection-necessity as complete development
    - From formal through concrete to absolute objective reasoning

    FINAL RESULT: OBJECTIVITY AS REALIZED CONCEPT!
    The transition from Subjective Logic (Concept) to Objective Logic begins!
    This completes the entire development of the Concept as Syllogism!

    SUBJECTIVE LOGIC COMPLETE - OBJECTIVE LOGIC BEGINS!
