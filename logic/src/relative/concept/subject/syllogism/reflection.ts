/**
 * THE SYLLOGISM OF REFLECTION: PRATIBIMBA-TARKA as Objective Systematic Reasoning
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The second sphere of Syllogism where PRATIBIMBA-TARKA achieves objective systematic
 * reasoning through concrete mediation. This represents the transition from formal
 * existence syllogism to reflection syllogism where the middle term is posited as
 * totality of determinations rather than abstract particularity.
 *
 * The Reflective Structure as Complete CITTA-VRITTI-PRATIBIMBA System:
 * - Extremes: Singularity proper and universality as determination of relation
 * - Middle: Totality of determinations embracing extremes within itself
 * - Unity: Reflection embracing extremes (first sublating of immediacy)
 * - Structure: Concrete determinateness with reference to others
 * This is consciousness achieving objective systematic reasoning through reflection
 *
 * The Three-fold Development:
 * 1. Syllogism of Allness: Understanding in its perfection (external universality)
 * 2. Syllogism of Induction: Experience through subjective gathering (bad infinity)
 * 3. Syllogism of Analogy: Singular in universal nature (immediate identity)
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - PRATIBIMBA-TARKA: Reflection-reasoning as objective systematic inference
 * - SARVA-VYAPTI: All-pervasion as concrete universality vs external allness
 * - ANUMANA-PRATYAKSHA: Inference-perception as inductive experience
 * - SADRISHA-ANUMANA: Similarity-inference as analogical reasoning
 * - JATI-VYAKTI-AIKYAM: Genus-individual unity as concrete mediation
 *
 * "The syllogistic term has thus posited itself as a determinateness in which also
 * the other determinateness shines reflectively" - Hegel

    - Middle as totality of determinations vs abstract particularity

    The Three-fold Reflection Development:
    1. Allness: Understanding in perfection (external universality)
    2. Induction: Experience through gathering (subjective universality)
    3. Analogy: Singular in universal nature (immediate universality)
    - SARVA-ANUMANA-SADRISHA: All-inference-analogy as complete development
    - Each form pointing beyond itself to higher necessity

    The Objective Reasoning Structure:
    - Not formal manipulation but objective systematic reasoning
    - VASTU-TANKA: Object-reasoning vs subjective formal approach
    - Concrete determinateness through referential structure
    - Reflection embracing extremes within itself as unity
    - Preparation for absolute necessity syllogism as final form

    REFLECTION VS EXISTENCE SYLLOGISTIC COMPARISON:

    Existence Syllogism Limitations:
    - Abstract particularity as middle term
    - Single determinateness admitting multiple alternatives
    - Contingent content through arbitrary middle selection
    - AKRIYA-MADHYAMA: Non-systematic middle creating contradiction
    - Formal approach generating infinite regress

    Reflection Syllogism Advances:
    - Totality of determinations as middle term
    - Concrete determinateness through referential structure
    - Objective reasoning through systematic gathering
    - MURTI-MADHYAMA: Concrete middle preventing contradiction
    - Understanding achieving its perfection through reflection

    The Systematic Progression:
    - Existence → Reflection: From formal to objective reasoning
    - Abstract → Concrete: From single to total determination
    - External → Internal: From contingent to systematic connection
    - SAKSHAD-PRATIBIMBA-KRIYA: Immediate-reflection progression
    - Preparation for absolute necessity as final syllogistic form

    But Reflection Limitations:
    - Still contains immediacy contradicting mediation
    - Presupposes conclusions rather than genuinely grounding them
    - APURVA-KALPANA: Unwarranted presupposition in all three forms
    - Points beyond itself to necessity syllogism as true objectivity

    TRANSITION FROM REFLECTION TO NECESSITY SYLLOGISM:

    The Reflection Achievement and Limitation:
    - Totality of determinations achieved as middle term
    - But unity still that of reflection embracing extremes
    - PRATIBIMBA-PARIGRAHAKA: Reflection-embracing vs absolute identity
    - Not yet absolute identity of concept
    - First sublating of immediacy, not absolute immanent reflection

    The Presupposition Problem Throughout:
    - Allness: Major premise presupposes conclusion
    - Induction: Experience presupposes genus in-and-for-itself
    - Analogy: Reasoning presupposes conclusion as immediate
    - PURVA-NIRDHARANA: Pre-determination problem requiring resolution

    The Necessity Requirement:
    - Middle must be not just totality but absolute necessity
    - Not external gathering but internal systematic necessity
    - NITYA-MADHYAMA: Necessary middle vs reflective middle
    - Objective universality vs subjective gathering
    - Concept's absolute identity rather than reflection unity

    RESULT: Necessity syllogism as absolute objectivity where middle term
    is the necessity itself connecting extremes through essential nature!

    ANIVARYATA-PARINAM: Necessity transformation as systematic completion!
