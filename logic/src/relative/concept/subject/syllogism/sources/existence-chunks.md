# Chunking Plan for Existence.txt - The Syllogism of Existence

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: The Syllogism of Existence (896 lines)
- Introduction: Immediate form, abstract determinacies, particularity as middle term
- 1. First figure: S-P-U schema, objective significance, Aristotle's definition, "therefore" grounded in extremes
- 2. Terms as content: Qualitative, singular determinacies, contingency and contradiction, Kant's antinomies
- 3. Determinations as connections: Premises need proof, infinite progression, mediation in other way
- a. First figure: S-P-U, singular emerges into existence, still subjective
- b. Second figure: P-S-U, negative unity, singular as middle, passes to third
- c. Third figure: S-U-P, reciprocal mediation, abstract universal as middle, fourth figure
- d. Fourth figure: U-U-U (mathematical syllogism), abstraction from determinateness, passes to reflection

**Key Insight**: Reason and Understanding are inseparable like Immediacy and Mediacy. The immediacy of Reason is internal (not sense perception).

## Chunk 1: Introduction - Immediate Form, Particularity as Middle (lines 4-36)

**Text**: Opening paragraph through "that alone constitutes the syllogism"

**Key Points**:
- Syllogism in immediate form has determinations of concept as immediate
- Abstract determinacies of form (not developed by mediation into concretion, only singular determinacies)
- First syllogism = strictly formal
- Formalism = stopping short at form of first syllogism
- Concept partitioned: singularity and universality = extremes, itself = particularity between them
- Because immediacy: determinacies only refer to themselves (one and all single content)
- Particularity = middle term (unites singularity and universality immediately)
- Because determinateness: subsumed under universal; singular subsumed under it
- Concretion = double-sidedness
- Middle term = simple determinateness (mediation not yet posited)
- Dialectical movement = positing moments of mediation

**Keywords**: immediate form, abstract determinacies, singular determinacies, strictly formal, formalism, extremes, particularity, middle term, double-sidedness, simple determinateness, dialectical movement

## Chunk 2: First Figure - S-P-U Schema (lines 40-53)

**Text**: "S-P-U is the general schema" through "for each is in its immediate determinateness"

**Key Points**:
- S-P-U = general schema of determinate syllogism
- Singularity connects with universality through particularity
- Singular not universal immediately but by means of particularity
- Universality not singular immediately but lowers itself through particularity
- Determinations stand as extremes, one in third term (diverse from them)
- Both determinateness (identical in this, universal determinateness = particularity)
- But also extremes with respect to particularity and to each other (each in immediate determinateness)

**Keywords**: S-P-U, schema, connects, by means of, lowers itself, extremes, third term, identical, universal determinateness, immediate determinateness

## Chunk 3: General Meaning - Singular Emerges into Existence (lines 55-78)

**Text**: "The general meaning of this syllogism" through "and is thus isolated"

**Key Points**:
- Singular (infinite self-reference, only inwardness) emerges through medium of particularity into existence
- Into universality (no longer belongs just to itself, stands in external conjunction)
- Conversely: singular sets itself apart as particularity (separation = concreted term, self-referring universal, true singular)
- In extreme of universality: singular gone from externality into itself
- Objective significance only superficially present (determinations not posited as unity constituting essence)
- Still subjective (abstract meaning only in subjective consciousness, isolated)
- Relation of S-P-U = necessary and essential form-relation
- Deficiency not in determinateness of form but in that each determination not richer under it

**Keywords**: infinite self-reference, inwardness, emerges, external conjunction, concreted term, self-referring universal, true singular, externality into itself, objective significance, subjective consciousness, isolated, form-relation, richer

## Chunk 4: Aristotle's Definition - Relation of Inherence (lines 87-115)

**Text**: "Aristotle confined himself rather" through "we must now see in greater detail"

**Key Points**:
- Aristotle: mere relation of inherence
- Definition: one extreme in entire middle term, middle term in entire other extreme → extremes necessarily united
- Expressed = repetition of equal relation of inherence (not determinateness of three terms to each other)
- Syllogistic inference rests on determinateness of terms to each other
- Other relations (other figures) have validity as inferences of understanding only to extent reducible to original relation
- Not diverse species alongside first but (1) rest on form of syllogistic inference, (2) variant forms into which first abstract form necessarily passes over (further determines, becomes totality)

**Keywords**: relation of inherence, repetition, equal relation, determinateness, inferences of understanding, reducible, variant forms, necessarily passes over, totality

## Chunk 5: S-P-U Schema - Subsumption and Inherence (lines 117-132)

**Text**: "S-P-U is thus the general schema" through "the extremes are joined together"

**Key Points**:
- S-P-U = general schema in determinateness
- Singular subsumed under particular, particular under universal → singular subsumed under universal
- Or: particular inheres in singular, universal in particular → universal inheres in singular
- With respect to universal: particular = subject
- With respect to singular: particular = predicate
- Or: as against one = singular, as against other = universal
- Both determinations united in it → extremes joined together

**Keywords**: subsumed, inheres, subject, predicate, united, joined together

## Chunk 6: "Therefore" Grounded in Extremes (lines 133-160)

**Text**: "The 'therefore' appears as an inference" through "which alone is at issue in the inference"

**Key Points**:
- "Therefore" appears as inference in subject (derives from subjective insight into relation of premises)
- Subjective reflection expresses connections as immediate judgments/propositions
- Conclusion = mediated connection (particular proposition)
- "Therefore" = expression that it is mediated
- But "therefore" not external determination (ground/seat in subjective reflection)
- Rather grounded in nature of extremes themselves
- Connection enunciated as judgment only for abstractive reflection
- True connection = posited as middle term
- "Therefore S is A": that judgment = merely subjective circumstance
- Not merely subjective judgment (not empty "is" but determinate middle replete with content) = meaning of syllogistic inference
- To regard syllogism as merely three judgments = formalistic view (ignores relation of determinations)

**Keywords**: therefore, inference, subjective insight, immediate judgments, mediated connection, grounded, nature of extremes, abstractive reflection, middle term, determinate middle, replete with content, formalistic view

## Chunk 7: Example - "All humans are mortal" (lines 166-210)

**Text**: "It is altogether a merely subjective reflection" through "surely not a whole made up of three propositions"

**Key Points**:
- Merely subjective reflection splits connection into isolated premises and conclusion
- Example: All humans are mortal, Gaius is a human, Therefore Gaius is mortal
- Boredom from futility of form (separate propositions give illusion of diversity dissolved in fact)
- Because of subjective attire, inference appears as subjective expedient (reason/understanding take refuge when incapable of immediate cognition)
- Nature of things does not operate this way (first major premise, then separate connection, then new proportion)
- Syllogistic inference from one separate proposition to another = nothing but subjective form
- Nature of fact = various determinations united in unity of essence
- Rationality not expedient; in contrast to immediacy of connection in judgment, it is objective element
- Prior immediacy of cognition = mere subjectivity (contrast to syllogistic inference = truth of judgment)
- All things are a syllogism (universal united through particularity with singularity)
- Surely not whole made up of three propositions

**Keywords**: subjective reflection, isolated premises, boredom, futility, subjective expedient, immediate cognition, unity of essence, objective element, mere subjectivity, truth of judgment, all things are syllogism

## Chunk 8: Terms as Content - Qualitative, Singular Determinacies (lines 212-246)

**Text**: "2. In the immediate syllogism" through "the singular can again attach to several universals"

**Key Points**:
- Terms have form of immediate determinations; consider as content
- Regard as qualitative (as judgment of existence)
- Terms = singular determinacies (determinateness posited because self-reference as indifferent to form, hence content)
- Singular = immediate concrete subject matter
- Particularity = one of determinacies, properties, relations
- Universality = more abstract, more singularized determinateness in particular
- Subject immediately determined, not posited in concept
- Concretion not reduced to essential determinacies
- Self-referring determinateness = indeterminate, infinite manifoldness
- Singular has infinite multitude of determinacies (any may serve as middle term)
- Through each middle term, singular attaches to another universal
- Through each property, enters different arrangement/context
- Middle term also concreted (contains several predicates)
- Through same middle term, singular can attach to several universals

**Keywords**: immediate determinations, content, qualitative, singular determinacies, self-reference, indifferent to form, immediate concrete, infinite manifoldness, middle term, different arrangement, concreted

## Chunk 9: Contingency and Contradiction (lines 247-304)

**Text**: "In general, therefore" through "from adhering to that middle term"

**Key Points**:
- Entirely accidental and arbitrary which property taken for connecting with predicate
- Other middle terms = transitions to other predicates
- Same middle term may be transition to different predicates (contains several determinations)
- Indeterminate number of syllogisms equally possible
- Any single syllogism contingent as regards content
- Syllogisms concerning same subject must run into contradiction
- Difference as such (indifferent diversity) = in essence equally opposition
- Concrete = concrete through unity in concept of opposites (determined as moments)
- In formal syllogism: concrete taken according one single determination → assigns predicate corresponding to middle term
- But from another side, opposite determinateness inferred → previous conclusion false (though premises/consequences correct)
- Examples: wall painted blue → blue (but can be green if yellow covered); senses → human neither good nor bad (but wrong, spirituality applies); gravitation → bodies fall into sun (but don't, centrifugal force); sociability → community of goods (but individuality → dissolution of state)

**Keywords**: accidental, arbitrary, transitions, contingent, contradiction, difference, opposition, unity in concept, opposites, false, examples

## Chunk 10: Kant's Antinomies - Form's Abstractness (lines 305-346)

**Text**: "It is only fair to hold" through "which content determinations it will infer from it"

**Key Points**:
- Nothing as unsatisfactory as formal syllogism (which middle term = chance/arbitrariness)
- No matter how elegant deduction, correctness conceded, amounts to nothing (possibility other middle terms from which opposite deduced)
- Kant's antinomies = from concept one determination laid down as ground at one time, another at another, both with equal necessity
- Insufficiency/contingency not blamed on content (as if independent of form)
- Lies in form of formal syllogism that content = one-sided quality
- Content destined to one-sidedness because of form's abstractness
- One single quality of many (because form not supposed to be more than immediate single determinateness)
- Extreme of singularity = abstract singularity = immediate concrete = infinite/indeterminate manifold
- Middle term = equally abstract particularity = single one of manifold qualities
- Other extreme = abstract universal
- Because of form, formal syllogism totally contingent as regards content (not which subject matter but which content determinations inferred)

**Keywords**: unsatisfactory, chance, arbitrariness, Kant's antinomies, equal necessity, insufficiency, contingency, one-sided quality, abstractness, immediate single determinateness, abstract singularity, infinite manifold, abstract particularity, abstract universal, contingent

## Chunk 11: Determinations as Connections - Premises Need Proof (lines 348-378)

**Text**: "3. The determinations of the syllogism" through "empty tautologies that lead to nothing"

**Key Points**:
- Determinations = determinations of content (immediate/abstract reflected into themselves)
- But essence = not immanently reflected, mutually indifferent, but determinations of form (essentially connections)
- Connections: (1) extremes to middle term (immediate connections, premises: particular to universal = major, singular to particular = minor), (2) extremes to one another (mediated connection, conclusion)
- Immediate connections (premises) = propositions/judgments
- Contradict nature of syllogism (different concept determinations should not be immediately connected but unity posited)
- Truth of judgment = syllogistic conclusion
- Premises cannot remain immediate (content = immediately differentiated determinations, not in and for themselves identical, unless identical propositions = empty tautologies)

**Keywords**: determinations of content, determinations of form, essentially connections, immediate connections, premises, major, minor, mediated connection, conclusion, contradict, truth of judgment, immediately differentiated, identical propositions, empty tautologies

## Chunk 12: Infinite Progression - Bad Infinity (lines 380-430)

**Text**: "Accordingly, the normal expectation is" through "comes up again"

**Key Points**:
- Normal expectation: premises will be proved (exhibited as conclusions)
- Two premises yield two further syllogisms
- These yield four premises requiring four new syllogisms
- Eight premises → sixteen conclusions → sixteen premises
- Geometrical progression to infinity
- Progress to infinity (occurred in sphere of being, not expected in domain of concept, absolute reflection, free infinity and truth)
- Bad infinity: contradiction of qualitative being and impotent ought
- Progression = repeated demand for unity, constant fall back into limitation
- In formal syllogism: immediate connection/qualitative judgment = basis, mediation = higher truth
- Infinite progression of proof does not resolve contradiction but perpetually renews it (repetition of original deficiency)
- Truth of infinite progression = sublation of it and form (determined as deficient)
- Form = mediation S-P-U
- Two connections S-P and P-U supposed to be mediated
- If done in same manner: deficient form S-P-U replicated to infinity
- With respect to S, P has form determination of universal; with respect to U, of singular (connections = judgments, need mediation)
- In that form of mediation, relation supposed to be sublated comes up again

**Keywords**: proved, conclusions, geometrical progression, infinity, bad infinity, qualitative being, impotent ought, repeated demand, perpetually renews, original deficiency, sublation, deficient form, replicated, comes up again

## Chunk 13: Mediation in Other Way - Second and Third Figures (lines 432-482)

**Text**: "The mediation must therefore occur" through "the unity of the two extremes"

**Key Points**:
- Mediation must occur in other way
- For mediation of P-U: S available → P-S-U
- To mediate S-P: U available → S-U-P
- Mediation of formal syllogism = contingent according content (immediate singular has indeterminate number of middle terms, external arbitrary choice)
- Not necessary, not universal, not grounded in concept (basis = external, immediate = singular)
- With respect to form: mediation presupposes immediacy of connection (mediation mediated by means of immediate = singular)
- Singular become mediating term through conclusion of first syllogism
- Conclusion S-U: singular posited as universal
- In minor S-P: already as particular
- Singular = that in which two determinations united
- Conclusion expresses singular as universal (not immediate but mediated, necessary connection)
- Simple particularity = middle term
- In conclusion: particularity posited as developed (connection of singular and universality)
- Universal still qualitative determinateness (predicate of singular)
- In being determined as universal: singular posited as universality of extremes or middle
- For itself = extreme of singularity, but determined as universal = unity of two extremes

**Keywords**: other way, P-S-U, S-U-P, contingent, external arbitrary choice, presupposes immediacy, mediated by means of immediate, mediating term, posited as universal, already as particular, united, necessary connection, developed, universality of extremes, unity

## Chunk 14: Second Figure - P-S-U, Negative Unity (lines 486-540)

**Text**: "1. The truth of the first qualitative syllogism" through "it is not the predicate of the particular"

**Key Points**:
- Truth of first: something not in and for itself united to qualitative determinateness (universal) but united by means of contingency/singularity
- Subject not returned in quality to concept (conceived only in externality)
- Immediacy = basis of connection/mediation → singular in truth = middle
- Syllogistic connection = sublation of immediacy (conclusion = connection through third term, contains negative unity)
- Mediation determined as containing negative moment
- Premises: P-S and S-U (first still immediate, second already mediated through first)
- Second presupposes first, first presupposes second
- Extremes determined as particular and universal (universal retains place as predicate, particular exchanged places = subject/extreme of singularity)
- Singular posited with determination of middle term/particularity
- No longer abstract immediacies but not yet concrete somethings (standing in place of other, posited in own determination and externally into other)
- Objective meaning: universal not in and for itself determinate particular (totality of particulars) but one of species through mediation of singularity (rest excluded by immediacy of externality)
- Particular not immediately/in and for itself universal (negative unity removes determinateness, raises to universality)
- Singularity relates to particular negatively (supposed to be predicate, not predicate of particular)

**Keywords**: truth, contingency, singularity, externality, basis, sublation, negative unity, negative moment, presupposes, exchanged places, abstract immediacies, concrete somethings, objective meaning, totality, excluded, negative unity, removes determinateness

## Chunk 15: Second Figure - Terms Still Immediate (lines 542-552)

**Text**: "2. But the terms are at first" through "accidental singularity"

**Key Points**:
- Terms still immediate determinacies (not advanced to objective signification)
- Positions exchanged = form (external to them)
- Still each content indifferent to other (two qualities linked together, not in and for themselves, through mediation of accidental singularity)

**Keywords**: immediate determinacies, objective signification, form, external, indifferent, accidental singularity

## Chunk 16: Transition - Realization and Alteration (lines 554-600)

**Text**: "The syllogism of the first figure" through "stop short at the first as the true form"

**Key Points**:
- First figure = immediate syllogism (abstract form not yet realized)
- Transition = beginning of realization (negative moment posited, further determinateness)
- But also alteration of pure form (no longer conforms fully, determinateness at variance with original)
- Regarded as subjective syllogism (external reflection) = species should conform to genus S-P-U
- But does not conform (premises P-S or S-P and S-U, middle term in both cases subsumed/subject, not middle term that subsumes/predicate in one, subsumed/subject in other)
- True meaning of lack of conformity = latter has passed over into it (truth = subjective, contingent conjoining)
- If conclusion correct: correct because so on its own, not because conclusion of this syllogism
- Same for conclusion of first figure (truth of first posited by second)
- View that second only species = overlooks necessary transition, stops short at first as true form

**Keywords**: immediate syllogism, abstract form, realization, negative moment, alteration, conform, species, genus, lack of conformity, passed over, subjective contingent conjoining, necessary transition, true form

## Chunk 17: Second Figure - Particular Conclusion (lines 601-625)

**Text**: "Hence, if in the second figure" through "be taken as major or minor"

**Key Points**:
- Second figure (referred to as third from ancient custom)
- To find correct syllogism: must be commensurate with first
- Since S-U has subsumption of middle under extreme, S-P would have to receive opposite relation (P subsumed under S)
- But such relation = sublation of determinate judgment S is P (could only occur in indeterminate/particular judgment)
- Conclusion in this figure can only be particular
- Particular judgment = positive as well as negative (no great value)
- Particular and universal = extremes, immediate determinacies indifferent to each other
- Relation itself indifferent (each can be major or minor, either premise can be major or minor)

**Keywords**: second figure, third, commensurate, opposite relation, sublation, particular judgment, positive and negative, indifferent, major or minor

## Chunk 18: Second Figure - Self-Sublating, Points to Universal (lines 627-653)

**Text**: "3. Since the conclusion is positive as well as negative" through "the abstract universal existing in itself"

**Key Points**:
- Conclusion positive as well as negative = connection indifferent to determinacies = universal connection
- Mediation of first = implicitly contingent
- In second: contingency posited
- Mediation = self-sublating (determination of singularity/immediacy)
- What syllogism joins together must be in itself and immediately identical (mediating middle = infinitely manifold/external determining)
- Posited = self-external mediation
- Externality of singularity = universality
- Mediation by means of immediate singular points beyond itself to mediation which is other (occurs by means of universal)
- What supposed to be united must be immediately conjoined (immediacy does not allow definite conclusion)
- Immediacy to which points = opposite of its own (sublated first immediacy of being = immediacy reflected into itself = abstract universal existing in itself)

**Keywords**: universal connection, implicitly contingent, self-sublating, immediately identical, infinitely manifold, external determining, self-external mediation, externality, points beyond, immediately conjoined, sublated first immediacy, reflected into itself, abstract universal

## Chunk 19: Transition - Qualitative Base, Concept (lines 655-670)

**Text**: "From the standpoint of the present consideration" through "we have another form of the syllogism"

**Key Points**:
- Transition like transition of being (alteration, base = qualitative, immediacy of singularity)
- But according concept: singularity conjoins particular and universal by sublating determinateness of particular (presents as contingency)
- Extremes not conjoined by specific connective in middle term (not determinate unity)
- Positive unity = abstract universality
- But middle term posited in this determination (its truth) = another form of syllogism

**Keywords**: transition of being, alteration, qualitative, immediacy of singularity, according concept, sublating determinateness, contingency, specific connective, determinate unity, abstract universality, another form

## Chunk 20: Third Figure - S-U-P, Reciprocal Mediation (lines 674-705)

**Text**: "1. This third syllogism no longer has" through "into determinations of content"

**Key Points**:
- Third syllogism no longer has single immediate premise
- S-U mediated by first, P-U by second
- Presupposes both, but conversely presupposed by them (each presupposes other two)
- Determination of syllogism as such brought to completion
- Reciprocal mediation: each syllogism for itself a mediation but does not possess totality (affected by immediacy whose mediation lies outside)
- S-U-P = truth of formal syllogism
- Expresses: mediating middle = abstract universal, extremes not contained according essential determinateness but only universality
- Precisely that not conjoined which supposed to be mediated
- Posited: wherein formalism consists (terms have immediate content indifferent to form, or form determinations not yet reflected into determinations of content)

**Keywords**: no single immediate premise, presupposes, reciprocal mediation, totality, affected by immediacy, truth of formal syllogism, abstract universal, not contained, formalism, immediate content, indifferent to form, not yet reflected

## Chunk 21: Third Figure - Negative Conclusion, Fourth Figure (lines 706-759)

**Text**: "2. The middle of this syllogism" through "something totally idle"

**Key Points**:
- Middle = unity of extremes (but abstraction from determinateness = indeterminate universal)
- Universal distinguished from extremes (abstract vs determinate) = itself determinate, whole = syllogism
- As universal, middle term = with respect to both extremes term that subsumes/predicate (not subsumed/subject)
- As species, ought to conform (can only happen if P-U contains appropriate relation)
- Occurs in judgment with indifferent relation (negative judgment)
- Syllogism becomes legitimate but conclusion necessarily negative
- Indifferent which determination taken as predicate/subject, which as extreme of singularity/particularity (major/minor)
- Which premise major/minor = matter of indifference
- Ground of customary fourth figure (unknown to Aristotle, void and uninteresting distinction)
- Immediate position reverse of first figure
- Subject/predicate of negative conclusion do not have determinate relation (each can take place of other)
- Indifference (to which particularity contributes) = makes fourth figure totally idle

**Keywords**: unity of extremes, abstraction, indeterminate universal, subsumes, predicate, conform, negative judgment, necessarily negative, indifferent, fourth figure, void, uninteresting, totally idle

## Chunk 22: Third Figure - Objective Significance (lines 761-783)

**Text**: "3. The objective significance" through "their equality, for its determination"

**Key Points**:
- Objective significance: mediating term as unity of extremes = essentially universal
- But universality only qualitative/abstract (determinateness of extremes not contained)
- Being conjoined must have ground in mediation outside this syllogism (contingent)
- Since universal determined as middle term and determinateness not contained, posited as wholly indifferent and external
- By virtue of bare abstraction: fourth figure arose (U-U-U, relationless syllogism)
- Abstracts from qualitative differentiation, has merely external unity (equality) for determination

**Keywords**: objective significance, essentially universal, qualitative abstract, not contained, ground, outside, contingent, indifferent external, bare abstraction, fourth figure, relationless, external unity, equality

## Chunk 23: Fourth Figure - Mathematical Syllogism (lines 787-831)

**Text**: "1. The mathematical syllogism" through "of its mode of thought"

**Key Points**:
- Mathematical syllogism: if two things/determinations equal to third, then equal to each other
- Relation of inherence/subsumption done away with
- "Third" = mediating term (absolutely no determination as against extremes)
- Each of three terms can be mediating term just as well as any other
- Which needed, which connections immediate/mediated depends on external circumstances (which two immediately given)
- Determination wholly external
- Ranks as axiom (first self-explanatory, neither capable nor in need of proof/mediation)
- Prerogative of being immediately self-evident lies in formalism (abstracts from qualitative diversity, only quantitative equality/inequality)
- For this reason not without presupposition/mediation (quantitative determination only by abstraction from qualitative differentiation and concept determinations)
- Examples: lines/figures equal only according magnitude; triangle equal to square (not as triangle to square but magnitude)
- Concept and determinations do not enter (no conceptual comprehension, understanding not faced by formal abstract determinations)
- Self-evidence rests solely on indigence and abstractness of mode of thought

**Keywords**: mathematical syllogism, equal to third, inherence subsumption done away, absolutely no determination, external circumstances, axiom, self-explanatory, formalism, quantitative equality, abstraction, qualitative differentiation, concept determinations, no conceptual comprehension, indigence, abstractness

## Chunk 24: Result - Positive Side, Mediation Based on Mediation (lines 833-869)

**Text**: "3. But the result of the syllogism" through "included within the circle"

**Key Points**:
- Result not just abstraction from determinateness
- Negativity has positive side: in abstract determinateness its other posited, determinateness become concrete
- Syllogisms of existence all have one another for presupposition
- Extremes conjoined truly conjoined only inasmuch as otherwise united by identity grounded elsewhere
- Middle term ought to be conceptual unity but only formal determinateness (not posited as concrete unity)
- What presupposed by each mediation = not merely given immediacy (as mathematical) but itself mediation (of each of other two syllogisms)
- Truly present = not mediation based on given immediacy but mediation based on mediation
- Not quantitative (not abstracting from form) but self-referring mediation (mediation of reflection)
- Circle of reciprocal presupposing = turning back of presupposing into itself (forms totality, has other included within circle, not outside by abstraction)

**Keywords**: positive side, other posited, concrete, presupposition, identity grounded elsewhere, conceptual unity, formal determinateness, concrete unity, mediation based on mediation, self-referring mediation, mediation of reflection, circle, reciprocal presupposing, turning back, totality, included within circle

## Chunk 25: Each Determination as Middle - Transition to Reflection (lines 871-896)

**Text**: "Further, from the side of the single determinations" through "passed over into the syllogism of reflection"

**Key Points**:
- In whole of formal syllogisms, each single determination has occupied place of middle term
- As immediate: determined as particularity
- Through dialectical movement: determined as singularity and universality
- Each determination occupied places of both extremes
- Merely negative result = dissolution of qualitative determinations into quantitative (mathematical syllogism)
- Positive result: mediation occurs not through any single qualitative determinateness but through concrete identity of determinacies
- Deficiency/formalism of three figures = one single determinateness supposed to constitute middle term
- Mediation determined as indifference of immediate/abstract determinations of form and positive reflection of one into other
- Immediate syllogism of existence passed over into syllogism of reflection

**Keywords**: each determination, middle term, dialectical movement, places of extremes, negative result, dissolution, quantitative, positive result, concrete identity, deficiency, formalism, single determinateness, indifference, positive reflection, passed over, syllogism of reflection
