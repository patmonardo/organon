CHAPTER 1

The absolute

The simple solid identity of the absolute is indeterminate,
or rather, every determinateness of essence and concrete existence,
or of being in general as well as of reflection,
has dissolved itself into it.
Accordingly, the determining of what is
the absolute appears to be a negating,
and the absolute itself appears only as
the negation of all predicates, as the void.
But since it must equally be spoken of
as the position of all predicates,
it appears as the most formal of contradictions.
In so far as that negating and this positing
belong to external reflection,
what we have is a formal, unsystematic dialectic
that has an easy time picking up
a variety of determinations here and there,
and is just as at ease demonstrating, on the one hand,
their finitude and relativity, as declaring, on the other,
that the absolute, which it vaguely envisages as totality,
is the dwelling place of all determinations,
yet is incapable of raising
either the positions or the negations
to a true unity.
The task is indeed to demonstrate what the absolute is.
But this demonstration cannot be either
a determining or an external reflection
by virtue of which determinations
of the absolute would result,
but is rather the exposition of the absolute,
more precisely the absolute's own exposition,
and only a displaying of what it is.
