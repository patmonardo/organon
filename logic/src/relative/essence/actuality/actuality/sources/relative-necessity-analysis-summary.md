| `act-b-4` | Real possibility — in-itself full of content | 47-55 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-b-5` | Real possibility as circumstances — totality of conditions | 57-117 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-b-6` | Real possibility — contradiction, completeness of conditions | 88-159 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-b-7` | Self-sublating real possibility — self-rejoining | 126-199 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `act-b-8` | Real necessity — cannot be otherwise | 162-228 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Numbered structure (1., 2., 3.) properly captured

### Note on Overlaps
- Multiple chunks overlap (chunks 5-11 have various overlaps). This is intentional as they represent different logical developments and perspectives on the same material, following Hegel's dialectical method where concepts are developed from multiple angles.

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Move to next species (absolute-necessity.txt)
