      "sourceText": "This cause now acts,\nfor it is the negative power over itself;\nat the same time it is its own presupposition;\nthus it acts upon itself as upon an other,\nupon the passive substance.\nHence, it first sublates\nthe otherness of this substance\nand returns in it back to itself;\nsecond, it determines this same substance,\nposits this sublation of its otherness\nor the substance's turning back into itself\nas a determinateness.\nThis positedness, because it is at the same time\nthe substance's turning back into itself,\nis at first its effect.\nBut conversely, because as presupposing\nit determines itself as its other,\nit then posits the effect in this other,\nin the passive substance.\nOr again, because the passive substance is itself this double,\nnamely a self-subsistent other,\nand at the same time something presupposed\nand already implicitly identical\nwith the efficient cause;\nbecause of this, the action of the passive\nsubstance is therefore itself double.\nIt is at once both the sublation of its determinateness,\nnamely of its condition,\nor the sublation of the self-subsistence\nof the passive substance;\nand also, in sublating its identity as\nit sublates this substance,\nthe pre-supposing of itself,\nthat is, the positing or supposing of itself as other.\nThrough this last moment,\nthe passive substance is preserved;\nthat first sublation of it appears in this respect\nat the same time also in this way,\nnamely that only some determinations are sublated in it,\nand its identity in the effect\nwith the efficient cause\noccurs in it externally.\n\nTo this extent it suffers violence.\nViolence is the appearance of power,\nor power as external.\nBut power is something external only in so far as in its\naction, that is, in the positing of itself,\nthe causal substance is at the same\ntime a presupposing, that is, posits itself as sublated.\nConversely, the act of\nviolence is therefore equally an act of power.\nThe violent cause acts only on\nan other which it presupposes;\nits effect on it is its negative self-reference,\nor the manifestation of itself.\nThe passive is the self-subsistent\nwhich is only a posited,\nsomething internally fractured\nan actuality which is condition,\nthough a condition that now is in its truth\nas an actuality that is only a possible,\nor, conversely, an in-itself that is only\nthe determinateness of the in-itself,\nis only passive.\nTo that which suffers violence, therefore,\nnot only is it possible to do violence,\nbut violence must be done to it;\nthat which has dominion over an other,\nonly has it because its power is that of the other,\na power which in that dominion\nmanifests both itself and the other.\nThrough violence the passive substance\nis only posited as what it is in truth,\nnamely, that because it is\nthe simple positive or the immediate substance,\nfor that very reason it is only something posited;\nthe “pre-” that it has as condition is\nthe reflective shine of immediacy\nthat the efficient causality strips off from it.\n\nPassive substance, therefore, is only given its due\nby the action on it of another power.\nWhat it loses is the immediacy it had,\nthe substantiality alien to it.\nWhat comes to it as an alien something,\nnamely that it is determined as a positedness,\nis its own determination.\nBut now in being determined in its positedness,\nor in its own determination,\nthe result is that it is not sublated\nbut rather that it only rejoins itself\nand in its being determined is,\ntherefore, an originariness.\nOn the one hand, therefore,\nthe passive substance is preserved\nor posited by the active,\nnamely in so far as the latter sublates itself;\nbut, on the other hand, it is the act of\nthe passive substance itself to rejoin itself\nand thus to make itself into\nwhat is originary and a cause.\nThe being posited by an other\nand its own becoming\nare one and the same.\n\nNow, because the passive substance has been converted into a cause,\nit follows, first, that the effect is sublated in it;\ntherein consists its reaction in general.\nAs passive substance, it is in itself as positedness;\nalso, positedness has been posited in it by the other substance,\nnamely in so far as it received its effect within it.\nIts reaction contains, therefore, a twofold aspect.\nFor one, what it is in itself is posited.\nAnd two, what it is as posited\ndisplays itself as its in-itself;\nit is positedness in itself,\nhence through the other substance it\nreceives an effect within;\nbut, conversely, this positedness is\nits own in-itself,\nit is thus its own effect,\nit itself displays itself as a cause.\n\nSecond, the reaction is directed at\nthe first efficient cause.\nFor the effect which the hitherto\npassive substance sublates within itself\nis precisely the effect of that other cause.\nBut a cause has its substantial actuality only in its effect;\ninasmuch as this effect is sublated,\nso is also the causal substantiality of the other cause.\nThis happens first in itself through itself, in that\nthe cause makes itself into an effect;\nits negative determination disappears\nin this identity and the cause becomes passive;\nand, second, it happens through the hitherto passive,\nbut now reacting substance,\nwhich sublates its effect.\n\nNow in determinate causality\nthe substance acted upon becomes a cause,\nfor it acts against the positing of an effect in it.\nBut it did not react against the cause of that effect\nbut posited its effect rather in another substance,\nand thus there arose the progression to infinity of effects;\nfor here the cause is only implicitly\nidentical with itself in the effect,\nand hence, on the one hand,\nit expires into an immediate identity\nas it comes to rest,\nbut, on the other hand,\nit revives in another substance.\nIn conditioned causality, on the contrary,\nthe cause refers back to itself in the effect,\nfor the latter is as a condition,\nas a presupposition, its other,\nand its act is therefore just as much a becoming\nas a positing and sublating of the other.\n\nFurther, causality behaves in all this as passive substance;\nbut, as we have seen, the latter becomes causal\nthrough the effect it incurs.\nThat first cause, the one which acts first\nand receives its effect back into itself as a reaction,\nthus comes up again as a cause,\nwhereby the activity which in finite causality\nruns into the bad infinite progression\nis bent around and becomes an action\nthat returns to itself,\nan infinite reciprocal action.",
