# Essential Relation Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: chapter-level and section-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Essential Relation.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook holds generalized idea material so it does not blur part-level analysis:

- chapter ideas (genus-level orientation),
- section ideas (cross-part framing),
- handoff logic between parts.

It does **not** contain Part A/B/C entry extraction.

## Source map (Appearance / Essential Relation)

- `A. THE RELATION OF WHOLE AND PARTS` (`whole-parts.txt`)
- `B. THE RELATION OF FORCE AND ITS EXPRESSION` (`force-expression.txt`)
- `C. RELATION OF OUTER AND INNER` (`outer-inner.txt`)

## Chapter Ideas (genus-level)

- ch1. Essential relation mediates immediacy and reflection as a single self-returning contradiction.
- ch2. The chapter movement proceeds through whole/parts -> force/expression -> outer/inner.
- ch3. Part-level determinations are species-level concretizations of this chapter-level genus.

## Section Ideas (cross-part)

- s1. Whole/parts exposes reciprocal conditioning and collapse of external self-subsistence.
- s2. Force/expression develops mediated transition from that collapse into dynamic expression.
- s3. Outer/inner completes the relational architecture of appearance through internal/external mediation.

## Part B lead-in ideas (text prior to `a.`)

- source: `force-expression.txt` lines `4-56`
- b0-1. Force is the truth of the resolved contradiction of whole and parts.
- b0-2. The relation of force is an immanent turning-back where unity is no longer external to manifoldness.
- b0-3. In this determination, reflected and immediate self-subsistence are moments; expression is disappearing-return into force.
- b0-4. Force's movement is translational self-preserving alteration, and its self-reference is conditioned/solicited by an other.

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. THE RELATION OF WHOLE AND PARTS` -> see `RELATION-PART-A-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. THE RELATION OF FORCE AND ITS EXPRESSION` -> planned `RELATION-PART-B-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. RELATION OF OUTER AND INNER` -> planned `RELATION-PART-C-V2-WORKBOOK.md`

## Session log

### Session: 2026-02-19

- Decision: chapter ideas and section ideas are centralized in this Idea workbook.
- Decision: keep generalized idea material separate from part-entry extraction to avoid cross-level confusion.
- Decision: initialize Part A decomposition with user-defined markers (`First`, `2`, and `Now...` synthesis split).
- Decision: for Part B, text prior to marker `a.` is captured as Idea-level lead material, and Part analysis starts at explicit `a./b./c.` markers.
