- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `fex-1` | Force — truth of whole and parts | 4-17 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-2` | Essential relation — moments | 19-23 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-3` | Three moments — transition, translation, mediation | 25-55 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-4` | a. The conditionedness of force — immediate subsistence | 59-87 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-5` | Force as matter — quiescent | 88-124 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-6` | Force — unity and activity | 126-157 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-7` | Force conditioned through force | 159-187 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-8` | b. The solicitation of force — presupposing | 191-209 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-9` | Solicitation — stimulus | 211-237 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-10` | Force expresses itself — reciprocal | 239-307 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-11` | Turning back — infinity | 309-340 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `fex-12` | c. The infinity of force — externality identical with inwardness | 344-369 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Structure (force → conditionedness → solicitation → infinity) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in infinity: externality identical with inwardness

### Key Concepts
- **Force**: Negative unity, truth of whole and parts, higher immanent turning back, unity of reflected and immediate subsistence
- **Conditionedness**: Force contains moment of existing immediacy, conditioned through itself as through force
- **Solicitation**: Reciprocal presupposing, stimulus, repelling of itself from itself is own positing
- **Expression**: Force expresses itself, soliciting only to extent solicited to be soliciting, each force is determinateness other has
- **Infinity**: Turning back of force into itself, externality identical with inwardness, reference to other is reference to itself

### Scientific Filtering for LO Store/KnowledgeStore
- ✓ Captures essential logical structure: force as negative unity, relation, activity
- ✓ Identifies key predicates: conditionedness, solicitation, expression, infinity
- ✓ Maps dialectical progression: from whole/parts → force → expression → infinity
- ✓ Ready for Logical Operations extraction

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis
- ✓ Suitable for filtering into LO Store/KnowledgeStore

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
