# Source Analysis Summary: outer-inner.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 232
- **Chunks Extracted**: 5
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `oin-1` | Expression of force — reflective shine | 4-31 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `oin-2` | Inner and outer — one identity | 33-66 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `oin-3` | Form determinations — immediate conversion | 68-155 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `oin-4` | Two identities — totality | 157-181 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `oin-5` | Each as totality — actuality | 183-231 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Structure (expression → identity → conversion → totality → actuality) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in actuality

### Key Concepts
- **Expression of force**: Mediation of reflected unity with itself, reflective shine is independent subsistence
- **Inner and outer**: Only one identity, substrate replete of content, absolute fact, two sides same according to content
- **Form determinations**: One immediately other, something only inner for that reason only outer, each term immediately opposite
- **Two identities**: Substrate as content, and pure form, totality is conversion of one into other
- **Actuality**: Each is totality through its other, externality is expression of what it is in itself, content and form absolutely identical, essence consists simply in being self-revealing
