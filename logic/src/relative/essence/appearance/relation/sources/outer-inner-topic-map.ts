Externality immediately taken back into unity. Difference of self-subsisting forces sublates itself. Expression of force only mediation of reflected unity with itself. Present is empty and transparent difference, reflective shine. Shine is mediation which is independent subsistence. Not just transition. Immediacy itself only posited.

Outer as form of immediacy reflected into other, unessentiality. Determinations constitute just one identity. Inner and outer as determinations of form: simple form itself, and determined as opposite. Unity is pure abstract determination in which one immediately other. Inner immediately only outer, outer only inner. Unity holds two as opposites. Identity only transition, only other of both, not identity replete with content. Something only inner, for that reason only outer. Something only outer, for that reason only inner. Each presupposes other, passes over into it as truth.

Transition immediate identity as substrate, also mediated identity: each is totality precisely through its other. Totality mediates itself with itself through form, determinateness mediates itself through simple identity. What something is, that it is entirely in externality. Externality is totality and unity reflected into itself. Appearance not only reflection-into-other but immanent reflection. Externality expression of what it is in itself. Content and form absolutely identical. In and for itself, nothing but to express itself. Revealing of essence, essence consists simply in being self-revealing.
