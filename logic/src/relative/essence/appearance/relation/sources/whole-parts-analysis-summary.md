# Source Analysis Summary: whole-parts.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 263
- **Chunks Extracted**: 12
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `wlp-1` | Essential relation — two sides | 4-50 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-2` | Relation contains contradiction | 52-63 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-3` | Whole — self-externalized | 65-82 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-4` | Parts — whole relation | 84-106 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-5` | Reciprocal conditioning — unconditioned | 108-131 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-6` | Two respects — identity and indifference | 133-139 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-7` | Essential identity — equality | 141-153 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-8` | Whole equal to parts — tautology | 155-173 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-9` | Parts equal to whole — tautology | 175-187 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-10` | Fall apart — destroy themselves | 189-221 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-11` | Truth of relation — mediation | 223-247 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wlp-12` | Transition — force and expressions | 249-262 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Structure (two sides → contradiction → tautology → mediation → transition) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in transition to force and expressions

### Key Concepts
- **Essential relation**: Self-subsistence reflected into itself, simple form, whole is world-in-itself, parts is world of appearance
- **Contradiction**: Relation contains self-subsistence and sublatedness, immediate contradiction, sublates itself
- **Self-externalization**: Whole has subsistence in parts, consists of parts, only relative
- **Reciprocal conditioning**: Whole and parts condition each other, turning back into itself, unconditioned
- **Equality**: Whole equal to parts, parts equal to whole, nothing in whole not in parts
- **Tautology**: Whole as whole equal to whole, parts as parts equal to themselves
- **Mediation**: Truth consists in mediation, contradiction returns to ground, self-subsistence only in order to disappear
- **Transition**: Passed over into relation of force and its expressions

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Continue with force and expressions
