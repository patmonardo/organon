# Chunking Plan for whole-parts.txt - The Relation of Whole and Parts

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: The Relation of Whole and Parts (263 lines)
- Essential relation — two sides (lines 4-50)
- Relation contains contradiction (lines 52-63)
- Whole — self-externalized (lines 65-82)
- Parts — whole relation (lines 84-106)
- Reciprocal conditioning — unconditioned (lines 108-131)
- Two respects — identity and indifference (lines 133-139)
- Essential identity — equality (lines 141-153)
- Whole equal to parts — tautology (lines 155-173)
- Parts equal to whole — tautology (lines 175-187)

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Essential relation — two sides
**Lines**: 4-50
**Title**: Essential relation — two sides
**Key Points**:
- Essential relation contains self-subsistence of concrete existence reflected into itself
- Simple form whose determinations are concrete existences
- Posited at same time, moments held in unity
- Self-subsistence reflected into itself is reflection into opposite
- Immediate self-subsistence
- Subsistence is identity with opposite no less than own self-subsistence
- Other side immediately posited
- Immediate self-subsistence determined as other
- In itself multifarious manifold
- Manifold essentially has reference of other side, unity of reflected self-subsistence
- One side, whole, is self-subsistence that constitutes world existing in-and-for-itself
- Other side, parts, is immediate concrete existence which was world of appearance
- In relation of whole and parts, two sides are self-subsistences
- Each has other reflectively shining in it
- Only is as identity of both
- Essential relation at first only first, immediate relation
- Negative unity and positive self-subsistence bound together by "also"
- Two sides both posited as moments, equally concretely existing self-subsistences
- Whole, reflected self-subsistence, as concrete self-existent first
- Immediate in it as moment
- Whole constitutes unity of two sides, substrate
- Immediate concrete existence as positedness
- Conversely, on side of parts, immediate manifold concrete existence is self-subsistent substrate
- Reflected unity, whole, only external reference

### Chunk 2: Relation contains contradiction
**Lines**: 52-63
**Title**: Relation contains contradiction
**Key Points**:
- Relation contains self-subsistence of sides and their sublatedness no less
- Two simply in one reference
- Whole is self-subsistent
- Parts are only moments of unity
- But also equally self-subsistent
- Reflected unity only moment
- Each, in self-subsistence, simply relative of other
- Relation within it immediate contradiction
- Sublates itself

### Chunk 3: Whole — self-externalized
**Lines**: 65-82
**Title**: Whole — self-externalized
**Key Points**:
- Whole is reflected unity that stands independently on own
- But subsistence equally repelled by it
- Self-externalized
- Has subsistence in opposite, manifold immediacy, parts
- Whole consists of parts, apart from them not anything
- Whole relation and self-subsistent totality
- But for precisely this reason, only relative
- What makes it totality is rather other, parts
- Does not have subsistence within it but in other

### Chunk 4: Parts — whole relation
**Lines**: 84-106
**Title**: Parts — whole relation
**Key Points**:
- Parts likewise whole relation
- Immediate as against reflected self-subsistence
- Do not subsist in whole but for themselves
- Have whole within them as moment
- Whole constitutes connecting reference
- Without whole no parts
- But because self-subsistent, connection only external moment
- With respect to which in-and-for-themselves indifferent
- But parts, as manifold concrete existence, collapse together
- Concrete existence is reflectionless being
- Have self-subsistence only in reflected unity
- Which is unity as well as concrete existent manifoldness
- Have self-subsistence only in whole
- But whole at same time self-subsistence which is other to parts

### Chunk 5: Reciprocal conditioning — unconditioned
**Lines**: 108-131
**Title**: Reciprocal conditioning — unconditioned
**Key Points**:
- Whole and parts reciprocally condition each other
- Relation higher than reference of conditioned and condition
- Reference realized: condition is essential self-subsistence of conditioned
- Presupposed by latter
- Condition as such only immediate, implicitly presupposed
- Whole, through condition of parts, entails it only in so far as has parts for presupposition
- Both sides posited as conditioning each other reciprocally
- Each immediate self-subsistence
- But self-subsistence equally mediated or posited through other
- Whole relation, because of reciprocity, is turning back of conditioning into itself
- Non-relative, unconditioned

### Chunk 6: Two respects — identity and indifference
**Lines**: 133-139
**Title**: Two respects — identity and indifference
**Key Points**:
- Inasmuch as each side has self-subsistence not in it but in other
- Only one identity of two in which both only moments
- But inasmuch as each self-subsistent on own
- Two are two self-subsistent concrete existences indifferent to each other

### Chunk 7: Essential identity — equality
**Lines**: 141-153
**Title**: Essential identity — equality
**Key Points**:
- In first respect, essential identity of two sides
- Whole equal to parts and parts equal to whole
- Nothing in whole which is not in parts
- Nothing in parts which is not in whole
- Whole not abstract unity but unity of diversified manifoldness
- Unity within which manifold held together is determinateness
- By virtue of which latter is parts
- Relation has indivisible identity and only one self-subsistence

### Chunk 8: Whole equal to parts — tautology
**Lines**: 155-173
**Title**: Whole equal to parts — tautology
**Key Points**:
- Whole equal to parts but not to them as parts
- Whole is reflected unity
- Parts constitute determinate moment or otherness of unity
- Diversified manifold
- Whole not equal to them as self-subsistent diversity but to them together
- Their "together" nothing else but unity, whole as such
- In parts, whole only equal to itself
- Equality expresses only tautology
- Whole as whole equal not to parts but to whole

### Chunk 9: Parts equal to whole — tautology
**Lines**: 175-187
**Title**: Parts equal to whole — tautology
**Key Points**:
- Parts equal to whole
- But because, as parts, moment of otherness
- Not equal to it as unity
- But one of whole's manifold determinations maps over part
- Equal to whole as manifold
- Equal to it as apportioned whole, as parts
- Same tautology: parts as parts equal not to whole as such
- But in whole, to themselves

### Chunk 10: Fall apart — destroy themselves
**Lines**: 189-221
**Title**: Fall apart — destroy themselves
**Key Points**:
- Whole and parts fall indifferently apart
- Each side refers only to itself
- As held apart, destroy themselves
- Whole indifferent towards parts is abstract identity, undifferentiated in itself
- Identity whole only inasmuch as differentiated in itself
- Manifold determinations reflected into themselves, immediate self-subsistence
- Identity of reflection has shown through movement
- Has reflection into other for truth
- Parts, indifferent to unity of whole, only unconnected manifold
- Inherently other which, as such, other of itself and only sublates itself
- Self-reference of each side is self-subsistence
- But self-subsistence each side has for itself is negation of respective selves
- Each side has self-subsistence not within but in other side
- Other constitutes subsistence, presupposed immediate
- Supposed to be first and starting point
- But first of each side only first which is not first
- Has beginning in other

### Chunk 11: Truth of relation — mediation
**Lines**: 223-247
**Title**: Truth of relation — mediation
**Key Points**:
- Truth of relation consists in mediation
- Essence is negative unity
- In which both reflected and existent immediacy equally sublated
- Relation is contradiction that returns to ground
- Into unity which, as turning back, is reflected unity
- But since equally posited itself as sublated
- Refers to itself negatively, makes itself into existent immediacy
- Unity's negative reference, in so far as first and immediate
- Only is as mediated by other and equally posited
- Other, existent immediacy, equally only as sublated
- Self-subsistence is first, but only in order to disappear
- Has existence which is posited and mediated

### Chunk 12: Transition — force and expressions
**Lines**: 249-262
**Title**: Transition — force and expressions
**Key Points**:
- Determined in this way, relation no longer one of whole and parts
- Previous immediacy of sides passed over into positedness and mediation
- Each side posited, in so far as immediate, as self-sublating and passing over into other
- In so far as negative reference, posited as conditioned through other, through positive
- Immediate transition of each equally mediation, sublating posited through other
- Relation of whole and parts passed over into relation of force and its expressions
