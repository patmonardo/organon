# Thingness Idea Workbook (View from Above)

Status: active
Scope: chapter-level idea structure only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Thingness.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the "view from above" framing for the Thingness chapter stack:

- chapter-level orientation,
- movement from thing-with-properties into material constitution,
- dissolution into appearance.

It does **not** do Part A/B/C entry analysis; those are separate workbooks.

## Source map (Appearance / Thingness)

- Chapter marker in source: `CHAPTER 1 — Concrete existence`
- Parts:
  - `A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES` (`thing.txt`)
  - `B. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE THING OUT OF MATTERS` (`matter.txt`)
  - `C. DISSOLUTION OF THE THING` (`dissolution.txt`)

## Part A structure marker

Part A has one explicitly numbered subpart and two non-numbered subparts:

- `a. The thing in itself and concrete existence` -> explicitly numbered `1/2/3`
- `b. Property` -> non-numbered
- `c. The reciprocal action of things` -> non-numbered

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES` -> see `THING-PART-A-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE THING OUT OF MATTERS` -> see `THING-PART-B-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. DISSOLUTION OF THE THING` -> see `THING-PART-C-V2-WORKBOOK.md`

## Session log

### Session: 2026-02-19

- Decision: initialize a local Thingness contract + workbook stack in this folder.
- Decision: keep one dedicated Idea workbook separate from Part A/B/C analysis.
- Decision: enforce explicit `a.1/a.2/a.3` span discipline only in Part A subpart `a`; keep non-numbered handling for Part A `b/c` and for Parts B/C.
