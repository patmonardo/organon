# Source Analysis Summary: dissolution.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 112
- **Chunks Extracted**: 6
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `dis-1` | Thing absolutely alterable — dissolution | 4-18 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `dis-2` | Absolutely dissoluble thing — externality | 20-31 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `dis-3` | Matters — negative reference | 32-54 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `dis-4` | Connecting reference — interpenetration | 56-72 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `dis-5` | Puncticity — porosity | 73-101 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `dis-6` | Concrete existence — appearance | 103-111 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Structure (alterability → dissolution → porosity → appearance) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in appearance

### Key Concepts
- **Dissolution** (Realism): Thing absolutely alterable, matters circulate unchecked, absolute porosity, external dissolution of external bond
- **Absolutely dissoluble**: Thing is only "also," consists only of externality, "this" thing whole is dissolution of itself
- **Negative reference**: Matters lack negative self-subsistence, negative reflection is puncticity, one matter not what other is
- **Interpenetration**: Matters subsist and do not subsist simultaneously, self-contradictory subsistence
- **Porosity**: Matters essentially porous, one subsists in pores of others, subsistence is sublatedness, self-contradictory mediation
- **Appearance**: Concrete existence has completion, has in-itself in unessentiality, subsists in absolute other, has nothingness for substrate

### Realism/Idealism Distinction
- **Realism (this section)**: Things "dissolve" - external dissolution, porosity, matters circulating, breaking apart
- **Idealism (next section)**: Worlds/Laws "disappear" - different mode of vanishing, form/formless oscillation

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Continue with World/Law section (Idealism - "disappear")
