# Chunking Plan for dissolution.txt - Dissolution of the Thing

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: Dissolution of the Thing (112 lines)
- Thing absolutely alterable — dissolution (lines 4-18)
- Absolutely dissoluble thing — externality (lines 20-31)
- Matters — negative reference (lines 32-54)
- Connecting reference — interpenetration (lines 56-72)
- Puncticity — porosity (lines 73-101)
- Concrete existence — appearance (lines 103-111)

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Thing absolutely alterable — dissolution
**Lines**: 4-18
**Title**: Thing absolutely alterable — dissolution
**Key Points**:
- Thing, as merely quantitative combination of free matters, is absolutely alterable
- Alteration consists in matters being dropped from collection
- Or added to "also"
- Or rearrangement of matters' quantitative ratio
- Coming-to-be and passing-away is external dissolution of external bond
- Binding for which indifferent whether bound or not
- Stuffs circulate unchecked in or out of "this" thing
- Thing itself is absolute porosity without measure or form of its own

### Chunk 2: Absolutely dissoluble thing — externality
**Lines**: 20-31
**Title**: Absolutely dissoluble thing — externality
**Key Points**:
- Thing, in absolute determinateness through which it is "this," is absolutely dissoluble thing
- Dissolution is external process of being determined, just like being of thing
- But dissolution and externality of being is essential of this being
- Thing is only "also"
- Consists only of externality
- But consists also of matters
- Not just abstract "this" but "this" thing whole is dissolution of itself
- Thing determined as external collection of self-subsisting matters

### Chunk 3: Matters — negative reference
**Lines**: 32-54
**Title**: Matters — negative reference
**Key Points**:
- Matters are not things, lack negative self-subsistence
- Properties are rather self-subsistent, determined with being reflected into itself
- Matters are simple, referring only to themselves
- But content is determinateness
- Immanent reflection only form of content
- Content not reflected-into-itself but refers to other according to determinateness
- Thing not only "also," not reference to each other as indifferent
- But equally negative reference
- On account of determinateness, matters themselves negative reflection
- Which is puncticity of thing
- One matter is not what other is according to determinateness
- One is not to extent other is, in accordance with self-subsistence

### Chunk 4: Connecting reference — interpenetration
**Lines**: 56-72
**Title**: Connecting reference — interpenetration
**Key Points**:
- Thing is connecting reference of matters to each other
- One matter and other also subsist in it
- Yet at same time, one matter does not subsist in it in so far as other does
- To extent one matter is in thing, other thereby sublated
- But thing at same time "also," subsistence of other matter
- In subsistence of one matter, other does not subsist
- And also no less subsists in it
- So with all diverse matters in respect to each other

### Chunk 5: Puncticity — porosity
**Lines**: 73-101
**Title**: Puncticity — porosity
**Key Points**:
- In same respect as one matter subsists, other subsists also
- One subsistence of both is puncticity or negative unity of thing
- Two interpenetrate absolutely
- Thing at same time only "also" of matters
- These reflected into determinateness, indifferent to one another
- In interpenetrating do not touch
- Matters essentially porous
- One subsists in pores or non-subsistence of others
- Others themselves porous
- In their pores or non-subsistence, first and all rest subsist
- Subsistence at same time sublatedness and subsistence of others
- Subsistence of others just as much sublatedness and subsisting of first and all others
- Thing is self-contradictory mediation of independent self-subsistence through opposite
- Through negation, or one self-subsisting matter through subsisting and non-subsisting of other

### Chunk 6: Concrete existence — appearance
**Lines**: 103-111
**Title**: Concrete existence — appearance
**Key Points**:
- In "this" thing, concrete existence has attained completion
- At once being that exists in itself, independent subsistence, and unessential concrete existence
- Truth of concrete existence: has its in-itself in unessentiality
- Subsists in other, indeed absolute other
- Has its own nothingness for substrate
- It is, therefore, appearance
