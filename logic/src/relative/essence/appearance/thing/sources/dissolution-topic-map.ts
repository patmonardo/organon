 * TopicMap for dissolution.txt - Dissolution of the Thing

 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the dissolution of the thing,
 * covering the absolutely alterable thing, porosity, interpenetration, and the
 * transition to appearance. Note: In Realism, things "dissolve" (as opposed to
 * Idealism where worlds/laws "disappear").
