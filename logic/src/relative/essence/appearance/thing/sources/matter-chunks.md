# Chunking Plan for matter.txt - The Constitution of the Thing Out of Matters

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

**Structure**: The Constitution of the Thing Out of Matters (153 lines)
- Transition of property into matter — chemistry (lines 4-25)
- Necessity of transition — property as essential (lines 27-43)
- First — negative moment preserved (lines 45-55)
- Second — thing progressed to determinateness (lines 57-71)
- Third — turning back unessential (lines 73-84)
- Movement of property — two moments (lines 86-118)
- "This" — complete determinateness (lines 120-152)

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Transition of property into matter — chemistry
**Lines**: 4-25
**Title**: Transition of property into matter — chemistry
**Key Points**:
- Transition of property into matter or self-subsistent stuff is familiar transition
- Performed on sensible matter by chemistry
- Seeks to represent properties of color, smell, etc. as luminous matter, coloring matter, odorific matter, sour, bitter matter
- Assumes others like calorific matter, electrical, magnetic matter
- Conviction that has gotten hold of properties as they truly are
- Saying that things consist of various matters or stuffs
- Careful about calling matters or stuffs "things"
- Will admit pigment is thing
- But luminous matter, calorific matter, electrical matter, etc., are they called things?
- Distinction made between things and components
- Without exact statement whether components are things or half-things
- They are at least concretes in general

### Chunk 2: Necessity of transition — property as essential
**Lines**: 27-43
**Title**: Necessity of transition — property as essential
**Key Points**:
- Necessity of making transition from properties to matters
- Or assuming properties are truly matters
- Resulted from fact they are what is essential in things
- Consequently their true self-subsistence
- At same time, reflection of property into itself constitutes only one side of whole reflection
- Sublation of distinction and continuity of property (concrete existence for other) with itself
- Thinghood, as immanent negative reflection and distinguishing that repels itself from other
- Has been reduced to unessential moment
- At same time, has further determined itself

### Chunk 3: First — negative moment preserved
**Lines**: 45-55
**Title**: First — negative moment preserved
**Key Points**:
- Negative moment has preserved itself
- Property has become matter continuous with itself and self-subsisting
- Only inasmuch as difference of things has sublated itself
- Continuity of property in otherness itself contains moment of negative
- As negative unity, self-subsistence is at same time restored something of thinghood
- Negative self-subsistence versus positive self-subsistence of stuff

### Chunk 4: Second — thing progressed to determinateness
**Lines**: 57-71
**Title**: Second — thing progressed to determinateness
**Key Points**:
- Thing has progressed from indeterminacy to full determinateness
- As thing in itself, abstract identity, simple negative concrete existence
- Concrete existence determined as indeterminate
- Then determined through properties, by virtue of which supposed to be distinguished from other things
- But since through property thing rather continuous with other things
- Imperfect distinction sublated
- Thing returned into itself
- Now determined as determined, determined in itself or is this thing

### Chunk 5: Third — turning back unessential
**Lines**: 73-84
**Title**: Third — turning back unessential
**Key Points**:
- Turning back into itself, though self-referring determination
- At same time unessential determination
- Self-continuous subsistence makes up self-subsistent matter
- In which difference of things, determinateness existing in and for itself
- Is sublated and is something external
- Therefore, although thing as this thing is complete determinateness
- Determinateness is such in element of inessentiality

### Chunk 6: Movement of property — two moments
**Lines**: 86-118
**Title**: Movement of property — two moments
**Key Points**:
- Considered from side of movement of property
- Property is not only external determination but concrete existence immediately existing in itself
- Unity of externality and essentiality repels itself from itself
- Contains reflection-into-itself and reflection-into-other
- On one hand, determination as simple, self-identical and self-referring self-subsistent
- In which negative unity, one of thing, is sublated
- On other hand, determination over against other
- But likewise as one reflected into itself and determined in itself
- Therefore, matters and this thing
- Two moments of self-identical externality, property reflected into itself
- Property was that by which things supposed to be distinguished
- Thing freed itself of negative side of inhering in other
- Become free from being determined by other things
- Returned into itself from reference connecting it to other
- At same time, only thing-in-itself now become other of itself
- Manifold properties have become self-subsistent
- Negative connection in one of thing now only sublated connection
- Thing is self-identical negation only as against positive continuity of material

### Chunk 7: "This" — complete determinateness
**Lines**: 120-152
**Title**: "This" — complete determinateness
**Key Points**:
- "This" constitutes complete determinateness of thing
- Determinateness which is at same time external determinateness
- Thing consists of self-subsistent matters indifferent to connection they have in thing
- Connection only unessential linking of them
- Difference of one thing from another depends on more or less of particular matters and in what amount
- Matters overrun this thing, continue into others
- That they belong to this thing is no restriction for them
- Just as little restriction for one another
- Negative connection only impotent "this"
- In being linked together, do not sublate themselves
- Self-subsistent, impenetrable to each other
- In determinateness refer only to themselves
- Mutually indifferent manifold of subsistence
- Only limit quantitative one
- Thing as this is merely quantitative connection, mere collection, their "also"
- Thing consists of some quantum of matter, also quantum of another, also yet another
- Combination, of not having any combination, alone constitutes thing
