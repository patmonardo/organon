# Chunking Plan for thing.txt - The Thing and Its Properties

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Concrete existence — principle
**Lines**: 6-16
**Title**: Concrete existence — principle
**Key Points**:
- Principle of sufficient reason: whatever is has ground, is posited, mediated
- Principle of concrete existence: whatever is, exists concretely
- Truth of being is to be, not immediate something
- But essence that has come forth into immediacy

### Chunk 2: Concrete existence — ground and unconditioned
**Lines**: 18-28
**Title**: Concrete existence — ground and unconditioned
**Key Points**:
- Whatever exists concretely has ground and is conditioned
- Also has no ground and is unconditioned
- Concrete existence is immediacy that has come forth from sublating of mediation
- Mediation results from connection of ground and condition
- In coming forth, sublates this very coming forth

### Chunk 3: Proofs of God — three kinds of being
**Lines**: 30-82
**Title**: Proofs of God — three kinds of being
**Key Points**:
- Besides immediate being (first) and concrete existence (second), third being proceeds from concept: objectivity
- Proof is mediated cognition
- Various kinds of being require each its own kind of mediation
- Ontological proof wants to start from concept
- Lays down sum total of all realities, concrete existence subsumed under reality
- Mediation is that of syllogism
- Kant's objection: by concrete existence understands determinate immediate existence
- Enters into context of total experience, determination of being other and in reference to other
- As existent concrete, something mediated by other, concrete existence is side of mediation
- In concept (something simply self-referring), mediation missing
- Ontological proof would demonstrate absolute concept attains determinate existence, mediation
- Or demonstrate how simple essence mediates itself with mediation
- Done by subsumption of concrete existence under universal, reality
- Middle term between God in concept and concrete existence
- How mediation of essence and concrete existence truly comes about contained in preceding exposition

### Chunk 4: Proofs of God — ground vanishes
**Lines**: 84-127
**Title**: Proofs of God — ground vanishes
**Key Points**:
- Proofs adduce ground for existence of God
- Not objective ground, for existence is in and for itself
- Solely ground for cognition
- Presents itself as ground that vanishes in subject matter
- Ground derived from contingency of world entails regress into absolute essence
- Accidental is groundless and self-sublating
- Absolute essence proceeds from that which has no ground
- Ground sublates itself, reflective shine of relation vanishes
- That God is grounded in other vanishes
- This mediation is true mediation
- But reflection in proof does not know nature of mediation it performs
- Takes itself to be merely subjective, distances mediation from God
- Fails to recognize mediating movement is in essence itself
- True relation of reflection: both in one
- Mediation as such but at same time subjective, external mediation
- Self-external mediation which internally sublates itself
- In other presentation, concrete existence given false relation of appearing only as mediated or posited

### Chunk 5: Concrete existence — not merely immediate
**Lines**: 129-176
**Title**: Concrete existence — not merely immediate
**Key Points**:
- Concrete existence cannot be regarded merely as immediate
- Taken as immediacy, comprehension of God's concrete existence declared beyond proof
- Knowledge immediate consciousness only, faith
- Knowledge should arrive at conclusion it knows nothing
- Gives up mediating movement and determinations
- But reflection, ending up with sublation of itself, does not have nothing for result
- Positive knowledge would not be immediate reference divorced from result
- End itself, foundering of mediation, is at same time ground from which immediate proceeds
- "zu Grunde gehen" unites meaning of foundering and ground
- Essence of God is abyss (Abgrund) for finite reason
- Reason surrenders finitude, sinks mediating movement
- Abyss, negative ground, is at same time positive ground of emergence of existent
- Essence immediate in itself, mediation is essential moment
- Mediation through ground sublates itself but does not leave ground standing under it
- Ground is, as abyss, vanished mediation
- Only vanished mediation is at same time ground
- Only through negation, self-equal and immediate

### Chunk 6: Concrete existence — essence passed over
**Lines**: 178-198
**Title**: Concrete existence — essence passed over
**Key Points**:
- Concrete existence not to be taken as predicate or determination of essence
- Not "essence exists concretely" or "it has concrete existence"
- Essence has passed over into concrete existence
- Concrete existence is absolute self-emptying of essence
- Emptying leaves nothing of essence behind
- Proposition: "Essence is concrete existence; it is not distinct from its concrete existence"
- Essence passed over inasmuch as essence as ground no longer distinguishes itself from itself as grounded
- Or inasmuch as ground has sublated itself
- Negation is no less essentially its position, simply positive continuity with itself
- Concrete existence is reflection of ground into itself
- Self-identity as attained in its negation
- Mediation that has posited itself as identical with itself and through that is immediacy

### Chunk 7: Concrete existence — thing
**Lines**: 200-209
**Title**: Concrete existence — thing
**Key Points**:
- Because concrete existence essentially self-identical mediation
- Has determinations of mediation in it
- But determinations at same time reflected into themselves
- Have essential and immediate subsistence
- As immediacy posited through sublation
- Concrete existence is negative unity and being-within-itself
- Immediately determines itself as concrete existent and as thing

### Chunk 8: A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES — introduction
**Lines**: 213-236
**Title**: A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES — introduction
**Key Points**:
- Concrete existence as concrete existent posited in form of negative unity
- Negative unity at first only immediate determination
- Oneness of something in general
- Concretely existent something different from something that exists immediately
- Former essentially immediacy that has arisen through reflection of mediation into itself
- Concretely existent something is thing
- Thing distinct from concrete existence just as something distinguished from being
- Thing and concrete existent immediately one and same
- But because concrete existence not first immediacy of being but has moment of mediation within it
- Further determination as thing and distinguishing of two not transition but analysis
- Concrete existence contains distinction in moment of mediation
- Distinction of thing-in-itself and external concrete existence

### Chunk 9: a. The thing in itself — essential and unessential
**Lines**: 240-275
**Title**: a. The thing in itself — essential and unessential
**Key Points**:
- Thing in itself is concrete existent as essential immediate that resulted from sublated mediation
- Mediation equally essential to it
- But distinction in first or immediate concrete existence falls apart into indifferent determinations
- One side, mediation of thing, is non-reflected immediacy, being in general
- Being, since determined as mediation, is existence other to itself, manifold and external within itself
- Not just immediate existence, also refers to sublated mediation and essential immediacy
- Immediate existence as unessential, as positedness
- When thing differentiated from concrete existence, then possible, thing of representation or thought
- Not supposed to exist
- Thing-in-itself and mediated being both contained in concrete existence
- Both themselves concrete existences
- Thing-in-itself exists concretely and is essential concrete existence
- Mediated being is thing's unessential concrete existence

### Chunk 10: Thing in itself — substrate
**Lines**: 277-301
**Title**: Thing in itself — substrate
**Key Points**:
- Thing in itself, as simple reflectedness of concrete existence within itself
- Not ground of unessential existence
- Unmoved, indeterminate unity
- Has determination of being sublated mediation
- Therefore substrate of that existence
- Reflection, as immediate existence mediated through other, falls outside thing-in-itself
- Thing-in-itself not supposed to have determinate manifold in it
- Obtains it only when exposed to external reflection, remains indifferent to it
- Thing-in-itself has color only when exposed to eye, smell when exposed to nose
- Diversity consists of aspects which other picks out
- Specific points of reference which other assumes
- Not thing's own determinations

### Chunk 11: External reflection — two moments
**Lines**: 303-327
**Title**: External reflection — two moments
**Key Points**:
- Other is reflection determined as external
- First, external to itself and determinate manifoldness
- Second, external to essential concrete existent
- Refers to it as to absolute presupposition
- Two moments of external reflection: own manifoldness and reference to thing-in-itself as other
- One and same
- Concrete existence external only in so far as refers to essential identity as to other
- Manifoldness does not have independent subsistence besides thing-in-itself
- Over against it, only as reflective shine
- In necessary reference to it, like reflex refracting itself in it
- Diversity present as reference of other to thing-in-itself
- Other nothing that subsists on own, only as reference to thing-in-itself
- Only is in being repelled from it
- Unsupported rebound of itself within itself

### Chunk 12: External reflection — collapses
**Lines**: 329-344
**Title**: External reflection — collapses
**Key Points**:
- Since thing-in-itself is essential identity of concrete existence
- Essenceless reflection does not accrue to it but collapses within itself externally to it
- Founders to ground, itself comes to be essential identity or thing-in-itself
- Essenceless concrete existence has in thing-in-itself its reflection into itself
- Refers to it as to other
- But as other over against that which is in itself, only sublation of self
- Coming to be in in-itself
- Thing-in-itself identical with external concrete existence

### Chunk 13: Thing-in-itself — plurality
**Lines**: 346-372
**Title**: Thing-in-itself — plurality
**Key Points**:
- Thing-in-itself is self-referring essential concrete existence
- Self-identity only in so far as holds negativity's reflection in itself
- That which appeared as concrete existence external to it is moment in it
- Self-repelling thing-in-itself which relates itself to itself as to other
- Plurality of things-in-themselves standing in reciprocal reference of external reflection
- Unessential concrete existence is their reciprocal relation as others
- Further, also essential to them
- Unessential concrete existence, collapsing internally, is thing-in-itself
- But thing-in-itself other than first
- First is immediate essentiality, present proceeds from unessential concrete existence
- Other thing-in-itself only other in general
- As self-identical thing, no further determinateness vis-à-vis first
- Like first, reflection within itself of unessential concrete existence
- Determinateness of various things-in-themselves falls into external reflection

### Chunk 14: External reflection — syllogism
**Lines**: 374-431
**Title**: External reflection — syllogism
**Key Points**:
- External reflection is relating of things-in-themselves to one another
- Reciprocal mediation as others
- Things-in-themselves are extreme terms of syllogism
- Middle term made up by external concrete existence
- Concrete existence by virtue of which they are other and distinct
- Difference falls only in connecting reference
- Send determinations from surface into reference, remaining indifferent to it
- Relation constitutes totality of concrete existence
- Thing-in-itself drawn into reflection external to it
- Has manifold of determinations
- Repelling of itself from itself into another thing-in-itself
- Repelling is rebounding back into itself
- Each thing-in-itself is other only as reflected back from other
- Has supposition not in itself but in other
- Determined only through determinateness of other
- Two things-in-themselves, since each has difference not in it but in other
- Not distinct things
- Thing-in-itself relates to other extreme as to another thing-in-itself
- Relates to it as to something non-distinguished from it
- External reflection is relation of thing-in-itself only to itself
- Essentially its reflection within itself
- Reflection is determinateness existing in itself, determinateness of thing-in-itself
- Determinateness not in reference external to it to another thing-in-itself
- Not just surface but essential mediation of itself with itself as with other
- Two things-in-themselves collapse into one
- Only one thing-in-itself relates itself to itself in external reflection
- Own reference to itself as to another constitutes determinateness
- Determinateness of thing-in-itself is property of thing

### Chunk 15: b. Property — negativity of reflection
**Lines**: 438-458
**Title**: b. Property — negativity of reflection
**Key Points**:
- Quality is immediate determinateness of something
- Negative by virtue of which being is something
- Property of thing is negativity of reflection
- By virtue of which concrete existence is concrete existent
- As simple self-identity, is thing-in-itself
- Negativity of reflection, sublated mediation, itself essentially mediation and reference
- Not to other in general like quality (not reflected determinateness)
- Reference to itself as to other, mediation which immediately is no less self-identity
- Abstract thing-in-itself is itself this relation which turns from another back to itself
- Determined in itself
- Determinateness is constitution, itself determination
- In relating to other does not pass over into otherness
- Excluded from alteration

### Chunk 16: Thing has properties — two sides
**Lines**: 460-488
**Title**: Thing has properties — two sides
**Key Points**:
- Thing has properties
- First, determinate references to something other
- Property there only as way of reciprocal relating
- External reflection of thing, side of positedness
- Second, in positedness thing is in itself
- Maintains itself in reference to other
- Admittedly only surface where concrete existence exposed to becoming and alteration
- Property not lost in this
- Thing has property to effect this or that in other
- Express itself in characteristic way
- Demonstrates property only under condition another thing has corresponding constitution
- Property characteristically thing's own and self-identical substrate
- Reflected quality called property
- Thing passes over into externality, property maintains itself in transition
- Through properties thing becomes cause
- To be cause is to preserve itself as effect
- Thing still static thing of many properties
- Not yet determined as actual cause
- Only reflection of determinations immediately existing in itself
- Not yet reflection that posits them

### Chunk 17: Thing-in-itself — ground
**Lines**: 490-535
**Title**: Thing-in-itself — ground
**Key Points**:
- Thing-in-itself has shown itself not only such that properties are positedness of external reflection
- Properties are own determinations by virtue of which relates in determinate manner
- Not indeterminate substrate located on other side of external concrete existence
- Present in properties rather as ground
- Self-identity in positedness
- But at same time conditioned ground
- Positedness equally reflection external to itself
- Reflected into itself and in itself only to extent external
- Through concrete existence thing-in-itself enters into external references
- Concrete existence consists in externality
- Immediacy of being, thing subjected to alteration
- Also reflected immediacy of ground, thing in itself in alteration
- Thinghood itself is ground-connection
- Property not distinguished from ground, not just positedness
- Ground that passed over into externality, truly reflected into itself
- Property is ground, implicitly existent positedness
- Ground constitutes form of property's identity
- Property's determinateness is self-external reflection of ground
- Whole is ground which in repelling and determining, in external immediacy, refers itself to itself
- Thing-in-itself concretely exists essentially
- Concrete existence, as external immediacy, is at same time in-itselfness

### Chunk 18: c. Reciprocal action — many things
**Lines**: 539-587
**Title**: c. Reciprocal action — many things
**Key Points**:
- Thing-in-itself exists in concreto by essence
- External immediacy and determinateness belong to being-in-itself, immanent reflection
- Thing-in-itself is thing that has properties
- Number of things distinct from one another, through themselves
- Many diverse things stand in essential reciprocal action by virtue of properties
- Property is reciprocal connecting reference itself
- Apart from which thing is nothing
- Reciprocal determination, middle term of things-in-themselves as extreme terms
- Indifferent to reference connecting them
- Is itself self-identical reflection and thing-in-itself
- Thinghood reduced to form of indeterminate self-identity
- Essentiality only in property
- Thing or things without determinate property: difference merely indifferent, quantitative
- What considered as thing can be made into plurality of things
- Separation or union external
- Determinateness in virtue of which thing is this thing only lies solely in properties
- Through them thing differentiates itself from other things
- Property is negative reflection and differentiating
- Only in property does thing possess difference of itself from others
- Difference reflected into itself
- Thing, in positedness (reference to others), equally indifferent to other and reference to it
- Without properties, nothing remains except unessential compass
- External gathering of abstract in-itselfness
- Thinghood passed over into property

### Chunk 19: Property — self-subsistent
**Lines**: 589-642
**Title**: Property — self-subsistent
**Key Points**:
- Thing, as extreme term existing in itself, supposed to relate to property
- Property to constitute middle term between things that stand connected
- Connection is where things meet as self-repelling reflection
- Distinguished and connected
- Distinction and connecting reference one reflection and one continuity
- Things fall only within continuity which is property
- Vanish as would-be self-subsisting extremes
- Property, supposed to connect self-subsisting extremes, is itself self-subsistent
- Things are unessential
- Essential only as self-differentiating and self-referring reflection
- But this is property
- Property in thing not as sublated, not just moment
- Truth of thing is only unessential compass
- Negative unity, but only like one of something, immediate
- Earlier thing determined as unessential compass by external abstraction omitting property
- Abstraction now happens through transition of thing-in-itself into property itself
- Inversion of values
- Earlier abstraction envisaged abstract thing without property as essential
- Property as external determination
- Thing as such reduced through itself to determination of indifferent external form of property
- Property freed of indeterminate and impotent bond which is unity of thing
- Property constitutes subsistence of thing
- Self-subsisting matter
- Matter is simple continuity with itself, only possesses form of diversity
- Manifold of self-subsisting matters
- Thing consists of them
