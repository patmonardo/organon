| `disa-2` | Difference disappeared — each becomes other | 22-28 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `disa-3` | World of appearance — law equal to itself | 29-39 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `disa-4` | World-in-itself — self-opposed | 40-54 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `disa-5` | Two totalities — identity of moments | 56-75 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `disa-6` | Law realized — essential relation | 77-99 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `disa-7` | World foundered — essential relation | 101-123 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Structure (opposition → disappearance → foundering → essential relation) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in essential relation

### Key Concepts
- **Opposition and inversion**: What is positive in appearance is negative in world-in-itself, complete opposition
- **Difference disappeared**: Each becomes the other, world-in-itself is world of appearance and vice-versa
- **Law equal to itself**: World of appearance is law equal to itself, other sublates itself
- **Self-opposed**: World-in-itself becomes self-opposed, self-inverting, essenceless content
- **Two totalities**: Each continues into other, identity of reflected and immediate moments, self-subsistence in unity
- **Law realized**: Inner identity existent, content raised to ideality, each side has other in it, law is essential relation
- **World foundered**: World has foundered both as essential world and world of appearance, still totality but as essential relation

### Realism/Idealism Distinction
- **Realism**: Things "dissolve" - external dissolution, porosity, matters circulating
- **Idealism**: Worlds/Laws "disappear" - difference disappears, each becomes other, world foundered, essential relation
- **Yoga/maya insight**: World can disappear because it is essentially imaginary/illusory - "quite imaginary"

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis
