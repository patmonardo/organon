 * TopicMap for disappearance.txt - The Dissolution of Appearance
 *
 * This TopicMap structures the logical development of the dissolution/disappearance
 * of appearance. Note: In Idealism, worlds/laws "disappear" (as opposed to Realism
 * where things "dissolve"). The world can disappear because it is essentially
 * imaginary/illusory (Yoga/maya insight).
