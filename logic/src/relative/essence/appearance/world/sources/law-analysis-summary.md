- ✓ Culminates appropriately in law as essential form

### Key Concepts
- **Appearance**: Essence in concrete existence, reflected concrete existence, higher truth, unity of reflective shine and concrete existence
- **Law of Appearance**: Simple self-identity remaining self-equal in flux, positive element of mediation, kingdom of laws, restful copy
- **Positedness**: Essential and true positive, Gesetz (Gesetztsein), essential positedness only to extent other is
- **Content**: Reflection of appearance into itself, complete determinateness (one and its other), same content in appearance and law
- **Kingdom of laws**: Restful copy of appearing world, concretely existing world is kingdom of laws, law is essentiality
- **Essential form**: Positive essentiality, content indifferent to connection, not yet real form

### Realism/Idealism Distinction
- **Realism**: "Being" = concrete existence (things dissolve)
- **Idealism**: "Being" = Law of Appearance (laws determine appearances/disappearances - dharma)
- **Shift**: From concrete existence to Law as the "Being" of World Appearance
- **Law**: Form/formless oscillation, determines appearances and disappearances
