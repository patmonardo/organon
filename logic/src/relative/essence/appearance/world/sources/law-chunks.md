## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Appearance — essence in concrete existence
**Lines**: 6-24
**Title**: Appearance — essence in concrete existence
**Key Points**:
- Concrete existence is immediacy of being to which essence has restored itself
- In itself immediacy is reflection of essence into itself
- As concrete existence, essence has stepped out of ground which passed over into it
- Concrete existence is reflected immediacy in so far as within it is absolute negativity
- Posited as such, determined itself as appearance
- Appearance is essence in its concrete existence
- Essence immediately present in it
- Not immediate but reflected concrete existence constitutes moment of essence
- Concrete existence, as essential concrete existence, is appearance

### Chunk 2: Appearance — only appearance
**Lines**: 26-42
**Title**: Appearance — only appearance
**Key Points**:
- Something is only appearance in sense concrete existence is only posited being
- Not something in-and-for-itself
- This constitutes essentiality: have negativity of reflection, nature of essence, within it
- No alien, external reflection to which essence belongs
- Comparing essence with concrete existence would declare latter appearance
- Essentiality of concrete existence, that it is appearance, is concrete existence's own truth
- Reflection by virtue of which it is this is its own

### Chunk 3: Appearance — higher truth
**Lines**: 44-62
**Title**: Appearance — higher truth
**Key Points**:
- If said something is only appearance, meaning contrasted with it immediate concrete existence is truth
- Then appearance is higher truth
- It is concrete existence as essential
- Whereas concrete existence is appearance still void of essence
- Only contains one moment of appearance: concrete existence as immediate, not yet negative reflection
- When appearance said to be essenceless, thinks of moment of negativity
- As if immediate were positive and true
- But immediate does not contain essential truth
- Concrete existence ceases to be essenceless by passing over into appearance

### Chunk 4: Essence appears — real shine
**Lines**: 64-89
**Title**: Essence appears — real shine
**Key Points**:
- Essence reflectively shines at first just within, in simple identity
- Abstract reflection, pure movement of nothing through nothing back to itself
- Essence appears, now real shine, since moments of shine have concrete existence
- Appearance is thing as negative mediation of itself with itself
- Differences are self-subsisting matters
- Contradiction: immediate subsistence, yet obtaining subsistence only in alien self-subsistence
- In negation of own, also in negation of alien self-subsistence or negation of own negation
- Reflective shine is same mediation
- Fleeting moments obtain in appearance shape of immediate self-subsistence
- Immediate self-subsistence of concrete existence reduced to moment
- Appearance is unity of reflective shine and concrete existence

### Chunk 5: Appearance determines itself — three moments
**Lines**: 91-123
**Title**: Appearance determines itself — three moments
**Key Points**:
- Appearance determines itself further
- Concrete existence as essential differs from unessential
- Two sides refer to each other
- First, simple self-identity containing diverse content determinations
- Both as identity and connecting reference of determinations
- Remains self-equal in flux of appearance
- This is law of appearance
- Second, law simple in diversity passes over into opposition
- Essential moment opposed to appearance itself
- Confronting world of appearance, world that exists in itself comes onto scene
- Third, opposition returns into ground
- That in itself is in appearance
- That appears determined as taken up into being-in-itself
- Appearance becomes relation

### Chunk 6: A. THE LAW OF APPEARANCE — appearance mediated
**Lines**: 127-169
**Title**: A. THE LAW OF APPEARANCE — appearance mediated
**Key Points**:
- Appearance is concrete existent mediated through its negation
- Negation constitutes subsistence
- Negation is another self-subsistent, but essentially sublated
- Concrete existent is turning back into itself through negation and negation of negation
- Has essential self-subsistence, equally immediately absolute positedness
- Has ground and other for subsistence
- Appearance is concrete existence with essentiality, positedness with ground
- Ground is negation, other self-subsistent equally only positedness
- Concrete existent reflected into other, has other for ground
- Ground itself only to be reflected into another
- Essential self-subsistence is return of nothing through nothing back to itself
- Self-subsistence only reflective shine of essence
- Linkage of reciprocally grounding concrete existents consists in reciprocal negation
- Subsistence of one is not subsistence of other but its positedness
- Connection of positedness alone constitutes subsistence
- Ground present as first which is only presupposed

### Chunk 7: Positive identity — essential content
**Lines**: 171-194
**Title**: Positive identity — essential content
**Key Points**:
- Negative side of appearance
- In negative mediation, immediately contained positive identity of concrete existent with itself
- Concrete existent not positedness vis-à-vis essential ground
- Not reflective shine in self-subsistent
- But positedness referring itself to positedness
- Reflective shine only in reflective shine
- In negation, in other which is sublated, refers to itself
- Self-identical or positive essentiality
- Identity not immediacy of concrete existence as such
- Only unessential moment of subsisting in other
- Essential content of appearance has two sides
- First, in form of positedness or external immediacy
- Second, positedness as self-identical
- According to first, determinate being, accidental, unessential, subject to transition
- According to other, simple content determination exempted from flux, permanent element

### Chunk 8: Content — complete determinateness
**Lines**: 196-229
**Title**: Content — complete determinateness
**Key Points**:
- Content besides being simple element of transient, also determined content, varied in itself
- Reflection of appearance, negative determinate being, into itself
- Contains determinateness essentially
- Appearance is multifarious diversity of immediately existing beings
- Revels in unessential manifoldness
- Reflected content is manifoldness reduced to simple difference
- Determinate essential content is complete determinateness: one and its other
- Each has in appearance subsistence in other
- But only in other's non-subsistence
- Contradiction sublates itself
- Reflection into itself is identity of two-sided subsistence
- Positedness of one also positedness of other
- Two constitute one subsistence, each different content indifferent to other
- In essential side, negativity gone back into identity
- Indifferent subsistence which is not sublatedness of other but its subsistence
- This unity is law of appearance

### Chunk 9: Law — positive element
**Lines**: 232-250
**Title**: Law — positive element
**Key Points**:
- Law is positive element of mediation of what appears
- Appearance is concrete existence as negative self-mediation
- Concrete existent through own non-subsistence, through other, through non-subsistence of other
- Mediated with itself
- Contains, first, merely reflective shining and disappearing of both, unessential appearance
- Second, persistence or law
- Each concretely exists in sublation of other
- Positedness as negativity at same time identical positive positedness of both

### Chunk 10: Law — opposed to immediacy
**Lines**: 252-267
**Title**: Law — opposed to immediacy
**Key Points**:
- Permanent subsistence appearance obtains in law
- First, opposed to immediacy of being which concrete existence has
- Immediacy is in itself reflected, ground gone back into itself
- In appearance simple immediacy distinguished from reflected immediacy
- That first began to separate in "thing"
- Concretely existing thing in dissolution has become this opposition
- Positive element of dissolution is self-identity of what appears
- Positedness in positedness of its other

### Chunk 11: Law — positedness
**Lines**: 269-286
**Title**: Law — positedness
**Key Points**:
- Second, reflected immediacy determined as positedness over against immediate determinate being
- Positedness is essential and true positive
- German Gesetz contains note of positedness or Gesetztsein
- In positedness lies essential connection of two sides of difference
- Diverse content, each immediate with respect to other
- As reflection of disappearing content belonging to appearance
- As essential difference, simple, self-referring determinations of content
- Neither immediate, just for itself, but essential positedness
- Only to extent other is

### Chunk 12: Appearance and law — same content
**Lines**: 288-329
**Title**: Appearance and law — same content
**Key Points**:
- Third, appearance and law have one and same content
- Law is reflection of appearance into self-identity
- Appearance, as immediate which is null, opposed to immanently reflected
- Distinguished according to form
- Reflection of appearance is essential identity of appearance and reflection
- Nature of reflection: in positedness self-identical and indifferent to difference
- Content continuous from appearance to law
- Content constitutes substrate of appearance
- Law is substrate itself
- Appearance is same content but contains more: unessential content of immediate being
- Form determination by which appearance distinguished from law is content
- Concrete existence is thinghood with properties and matters
- Content whose self-subsisting immediacy is also only non-subsistence
- Self-identity of content in non-subsistence is other, essential content
- Identity, substrate of appearance, constitutes law
- Is appearance's own moment, positive side of essentiality

### Chunk 13: Law — kingdom of laws
**Lines**: 331-343
**Title**: Law — kingdom of laws
**Key Points**:
- Law not beyond appearance but immediately present in it
- Kingdom of laws is restful copy of concretely existing or appearing world
- Two are one totality
- Concretely existing world is itself kingdom of laws
- Simple identity, self-identical in positedness or self-dissolving self-subsistence
- In law, concrete existence returns to ground
- Appearance contains both: simple ground and dissolving movement of appearing universe
- Law is essentiality

### Chunk 14: Law — essential appearance
**Lines**: 345-362
**Title**: Law — essential appearance
**Key Points**:
- Law is essential appearance
- Latter's reflection into itself in positedness
- Identical content of itself and unessential concrete existence
- Identity of law with concrete existence immediate, simple identity
- Law indifferent with respect to concrete existence
- Appearance still has another content contrasted with content of law
- Unessential and return into latter
- For law original starting point not posited by it
- Externally bound up with law
- Appearance is aggregate of more detailed determinations
- Belong to "this" or concrete, not contained in law
- Determined each by other

### Chunk 15: Law — restless form
**Lines**: 364-385
**Title**: Law — restless form
**Key Points**:
- That which appearance contains distinct from law determined as positive or another content
- But essentially negative
- Form and movement belongs to appearance
- Kingdom of laws is restful content of appearance
- Appearance is same content but displayed in restless flux
- Reflection-into-other
- Law as negative, relentlessly self-mutating concrete existence
- Movement of passing over into opposite, self-sublation and return into unity
- Restless form or negativity does not contain law
- Appearance is totality, contains law but more: moment of self-moving form

### Chunk 16: Law — diversity and necessity
**Lines**: 387-433
**Title**: Law — diversity and necessity
**Key Points**:
- Shortcoming manifested in law in mere diversity at first
- Consequent internal indifference of content
- Identity of sides immediate and hence inner, not yet necessary
- In law two content determinations essentially bound together
- Example: spatial and temporal magnitudes in law of falling bodies
- Traversed spaces vary as squares of elapsed times
- Bound together, connection at first only immediate
- Likewise only posited connection
- Essential unity would be negativity: each contains other in it
- But in law essential unity has not yet come to fore
- Not contained in concept of space that time corresponds as square
- Falling is ratio of space and time
- Time refers to space and space to time does not lie in determination of time itself
- Time can be represented without space, space without time
- One comes to other externally, external reference is movement
- More particular determination of how magnitudes relate indifferent
- Law drawn from experience, immediate
- Proof required, mediation, to know law not only occurs but is necessary
- Law as such does not contain proof and objective necessity

### Chunk 17: Law — essential form
**Lines**: 435-450
**Title**: Law — essential form
**Key Points**:
- Law is only positive essentiality of appearance
- Not negative essentiality according to which content determinations are moments of form
- Pass over into other, in own selves not themselves but their other
- In law, although positedness of one side is positedness of other side
- Content of two sides indifferent to connection
- Does not contain positedness in it
- Law is indeed essential form
- But not as yet real form which is reflected into sides as content
