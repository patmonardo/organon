- **Chunks Extracted**: 8
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `wld-1` | World raises itself to kingdom of laws | 4-23 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-2` | Law — negative reflection | 25-47 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-3` | Determination of law altered — negative unity | 49-77 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-4` | Law obtains negative moment — world-in-itself | 79-104 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-5` | Kingdom of laws — suprasensible world | 106-155 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-6` | World-in-itself — totality | 157-181 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-7` | Determinate ground — opposition | 183-240 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `wld-8` | World-in-itself — inversion | 242-258 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Structure (kingdom of laws → world-in-itself → inversion) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in world-in-itself as inversion

### Key Concepts
- **Kingdom of laws**: Simple, unchanging but diversified content, total reflection, absolute negativity or form
- **World-in-itself (suprasensible world)**: Totality of concrete existence, outside it nothing, reflected essential concrete existence, in more profound sense than being
- **Sensible world**: Intended for intuition, immediate attitude of consciousness
- **Suprasensible world**: Reflected, essential concrete existence, things of suprasensible world are true concrete existences
- **Opposition**: World splits internally as world of senses and world of appearance, identity determined as opposition
- **Inversion**: World-in-itself is inversion of world of appearance
- **Leibnizian resonances**: Suprasensible world, kingdom of laws, distinction between sensible and intelligible worlds

### Realism/Idealism Distinction
- **Realism**: Things "dissolve" - external dissolution, porosity
- **Idealism**: Worlds/Laws "disappear" - different mode of vanishing, form/formless oscillation
- **World-in-itself**: Suprasensible world, totality, inversion of world of appearance

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
