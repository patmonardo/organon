In other, that which appears comes to itself. Appearance in changing also enduring, positedness is law. Law is simple identity of appearance with itself. Substrate and not ground, not negative unity. Simple identity, immediate unity, abstract unity. Other content also occurs alongside. Content holds together internally, negative reflection inside itself. Reflected into other, other is concrete existence of appearance. Appearing things have grounds and conditions in other appearing things.",

Same, that which appears reflected not into other but into itself. Reflection of positedness into itself is law. As something that appears, essentially reflected into non-being.

    description: "Determination of law altered within law itself. At first, law only diversified content and formal reflection of positedness into itself. Positedness of one side is positedness of other side. But because also negative reflection into itself, sides behave not only as different but negatively referring to each other. If law considered for itself, sides indifferent. But no less sublated through identity. Positedness of one is positedness of other. Subsistence of each also non-subsistence of itself. Positedness of one side in other is negative unity. Each side itself negative unity. Positive identity at first only inner unity, stands in need of proof. But since sides determined as different in negative unity, each contains other within while repelling otherness. Identity of law now posited and real.",

Obtains moment of unessentiality as reflected unessentiality that has determinate being in itself, essential negativity. As immediate content, law determined in general, distinguished from other laws. But because explicitly essential negativity, no longer contains indifferent, accidental content determination. Content rather every determinateness essentially connected together, totalizing connection.

Moment of alterability and alteration, reflected into itself and essential, is absolute negativity or form in general. Moments have reality of self-subsisting but reflected concrete existence in world that has determinate being in-and-for-itself. Content not mere manifold but content holding itself together essentially. World in and for itself also called suprasensible world. Concretely existing world characterized as sensible, intended for intuition, immediate attitude of consciousness. Suprasensible world likewise has immediate, concrete existence, but reflected, essential concrete existence. Essence has no immediate existence yet, but it is, in more profound sense than being. Things posited only as things of another, suprasensible, world, first as true concrete existences, second as truth in contrast to that which just is.

Constitutes self-subsistence different from world of appearance. World of appearance has negative unity in essential world, to which it founders and into which returns as to ground.

As ground with content, determinate ground of other world. But such only according to content. World of appearance had other and manifold content than kingdom of laws, negative moment still peculiarly its own. But because kingdom of laws now has this moment in it, totality of content, ground of all manifoldness. But at same time negative of manifoldness, world opposed to it. In identity of two worlds, connection of ground restored as ground-connection of appearance. Not connection of identical content nor mere diversified content, but total connection, negative identity and essential connection of opposed sides. Kingdom of laws has negative moment, opposition. As totality, splits into world in-and-for-itself and world of appearance. Identity is essential connection of opposition. Connection of ground is opposition which in contradiction foundered to ground. Concrete existence becomes appearance. Ground reinstates itself as return of appearance into itself, as sublated ground, ground-connection of opposite determinations.
