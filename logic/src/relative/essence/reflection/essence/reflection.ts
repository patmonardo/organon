/**
 * REFLECTION (CITTA): Reflective Consciousness - Mind as Self-Determining Negativity
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * Reflection as CITTA - the determinate consciousness that emerges from the
 * internalization of Shine (CITI). This is "Reflective Consciousness" in the
 * deepest Vedantic sense - mind as self-determining, self-referring negativity.
 *
 * The Yoga progression complete:
 * - CIT = Pure Consciousness (Essence)
 * - CITI = Conscious Power/Shakti (Shine)
 * - CITTA = Reflective Consciousness/Mind (Reflection)
 *
 * "Shine is the same as what reflection is; but it is reflection as immediate.
 * For this shine which is internalized... the German has a word from an alien
 * language, 'Reflexion.'" - Hegel
 *
 * This is THE authoritative definition of CITTA as reflective consciousness!
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Two: Essence - C. Reflection
