# Chunking Plan for reflection.txt - Reflection

**SOURCE ANALYSIS PHASE 1: Planning Document**

**Purpose**: Systematic chunking methodology to yield meaningful Logical Operations.
The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel through step-by-step analysis.

**Status**: Work in progress - refining methodology as we practice.

**Workflow Stage**: **SEED** → **UPGRADES**
- **SEED**: Initial chunking plan (current state) - good enough to form initial seed
- **UPGRADES**: Refined chunks through actual study and editing
- As you study each chunk, edit and upgrade the seed chunks
- This document evolves from planning → studied/refined chunks

## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: Introduction — shine and reflection
**Lines**: 4-8
**Title**: Introduction — shine and reflection
**Key Points**:
- Shine is the same as reflection, but reflection as immediate
- Internalized shine alienated from immediacy
- German: "Reflexion" from alien language

### Chunk 2: Essence as reflection — movement from nothing to nothing
**Lines**: 10-54
**Title**: Essence as reflection — movement from nothing to nothing
**Key Points**:
- Essence is reflection, movement of becoming that remains within itself
- Distinguished determined as negative in itself, as shine
- Reflective movement: other as negation in itself, self-referring
- Negation as negation, negation with negation
- Immediacy is the movement itself, not substrate
- Movement from nothing to nothing, back to itself
- Being only as movement of nothingness to nothingness
- Pure absolute reflection further determines itself

### Chunk 3: Three types of reflection
**Lines**: 56-65
**Title**: Three types of reflection
**Key Points**:
- First: positing reflection
- Second: external reflection (takes presupposed immediate as starting point)
- Third: determining reflection (sublates presupposition, presupposes at same time)

### Chunk 4: Positing reflection — introduction
**Lines**: 69-84
**Title**: Positing reflection — introduction
**Key Points**:
- Shine is nothingness or lack of essence
- Nothingness has being as its own equality with itself
- Conversion of negative with itself: absolute reflection
- Self-referring negativity is negating of itself
- Sublated negativity as it is negativity
- Being itself and not being itself, two in one unity

### Chunk 5: Positing reflection — movement from nothing to nothing
**Lines**: 86-106
**Title**: Positing reflection — movement from nothing to nothing
**Key Points**:
- Reflection is movement from nothing to nothing
- Negation coinciding with itself
- Self-coinciding is simple equality with itself, immediacy
- Not transition into equality as being other than it
- Reflection is transition as sublating of transition
- Immediacy is self-equality of negative, self-negating equality
- Its being is to be what it is not

### Chunk 6: Positing reflection — turning back, positedness
**Lines**: 107-126
**Title**: Positing reflection — turning back, positedness
**Key Points**:
- Self-reference of negative is turning back into itself
- Immediacy as sublating of negative, self-sublating immediacy
- This is positedness, immediacy purely as determinateness
- Immediacy constitutes determinateness of shine
- Cannot begin with this immediacy; it is the turning back itself
- Reflection only in turning is that which starts out or returns

### Chunk 7: Positing reflection — positing and presupposing
**Lines**: 128-165
**Title**: Positing reflection — positing and presupposing
**Key Points**:
- Positing: immediacy as turning back, no other beforehand
- Only as turning back, negative of itself
- Immediacy is sublated negation and sublated return
- Sublating of negative is sublating of immediacy
- Equally negation of negative as negative: presupposing
- Presupposing: determines turning back as negative of itself
- Self-repulsion, presupposing of that from which reflection turns back

### Chunk 8: Positing reflection — self-repulsion, absolute counter-repelling
**Lines**: 167-211
**Title**: Positing reflection — self-repulsion, absolute counter-repelling
**Key Points**:
- Only by sublating equality with itself is essence equality with itself
- Essence presupposes itself, sublating of presupposing is essence itself
- Presupposition is only in turning back itself
- Transcending immediate occurs only through transcending
- Transcending immediate is arriving at immediate
- Forward movement turns immediately around into itself: self-movement
- Positing reflection is presupposing reflection, and vice versa
- Reflection is itself and its non-being, negative of itself

### Chunk 9: Transition to external reflection
**Lines**: 213-228
**Title**: Transition to external reflection
**Key Points**:
- Immediacy presupposed is simply and solely positedness
- Determined as negative, in opposition to other
- Reflection has presupposition, takes start from immediate as other
- External reflection

### Chunk 10: External reflection — doubled determination
**Lines**: 232-247
**Title**: External reflection — doubled determination
**Key Points**:
- Absolute reflection posits only shine, positedness, for presupposition
- Presupposing reflection is immediately positing reflection
- External reflection presupposes itself as sublated, negative of itself
- Doubled: presupposed (reflection into itself as immediate) and reflection negatively referring to itself

### Chunk 11: External reflection — presupposes being
**Lines**: 249-276
**Title**: External reflection — presupposes being
**Key Points**:
- Presupposes being, immediacy refers to itself
- Determinateness only as moment
- Reflection refers to presupposition as negative, sublated as negative
- In positing, immediately sublates positing, has immediate presupposition
- Finds presupposition before it, from which it starts
- Presupposition as negative/positedness not its concern
- In sphere of being, external reflection was infinite
- Finite stands as first, infinite as reflection into itself

### Chunk 12: External reflection — syllogism structure
**Lines**: 278-284
**Title**: External reflection — syllogism structure
**Key Points**:
- External reflection is syllogism
- Two extremes: immediate and reflection into itself
- Middle term: reference connecting two, determinate immediate
- Immediate falls to one extreme, determinateness/negation to other

### Chunk 13: External reflection — positing and sublating
**Lines**: 286-313
**Title**: External reflection — positing and sublating
**Key Points**:
- Positing of immediate, becomes negative/determined
- Immediately sublates positing, presupposes immediate
- Negating is negating of its negating, equally positing
- Immediate posited as same as reflection
- Externality sublated, coinciding with immediate is immediacy of essence
- External reflection is immanent reflection of immediacy itself
- Result of positing reflection is essence existing in and for itself
- External reflection is determining reflection

### Chunk 14: Determining reflection — unity of positing and external
**Lines**: 317-334
**Title**: Determining reflection — unity of positing and external
**Key Points**:
- Determining reflection is unity of positing and external reflection
- External reflection begins from immediate being, positing from nothing
- External reflection posits another (essence) in place of sublated being
- Positing has no presupposition, not complete as determining reflection
- Determination posited is only posited, immediate as self-negating
- Connection with turning back into itself is absolute
- Only in reflection-into-itself but not this reflection itself

### Chunk 15: Determining reflection — positedness vs. existence
**Lines**: 336-371
**Title**: Determining reflection — positedness vs. existence
**Key Points**:
- Posited is other, but self-equality of reflection retained
- Posited only as sublated, reference to turning back
- In sphere of being, existence had negation in it
- In sphere of essence, positedness corresponds to existence
- Positedness is existence, but ground is essence as pure negativity
- Determinateness not as existent but immediately as sublated
- Existence is only positedness: principle of essence of existence
- Positedness conjoins existence with essence
- Twofold meaning: in opposition to existence or to essence
- Positedness is superior, existence is negative, refers to turning back

### Chunk 16: Determining reflection — determination of reflection
**Lines**: 373-408
**Title**: Determining reflection — determination of reflection
**Key Points**:
- Positedness is determinateness as negation in general
- Positing united with external reflection: absolute presupposing
- Repelling of reflection from itself, positing determinateness as its own
- As posited, positedness is negation; as presupposed, reflected into itself
- Determination of reflection distinct from determinateness of being
- Quality is immediate reference to other; positedness is reference to immanently reflected being
- Negation as quality is existent negation; determination of reflection has immanent reflectedness as ground
- Determination persists by self-equality, not by being
- Quality is transient; determination of reflection is essential
- Self-equality of reflection gives subsistence, negative only as sublated/posited

### Chunk 17: Determining reflection — free essentialities, essential shine
**Lines**: 410-424
**Title**: Determining reflection — free essentialities, essential shine
**Key Points**:
- Determinations of reflection appear as free essentialities
- Sublated in void, without reciprocal attraction or repulsion
- Determinateness entranced, infinitely fixed by reference to itself
- Deflected reflection-into-other into reflection-into-itself
- Constitute determinate shine as it is in essence: essential shine
- Determining reflection is reflection that has exited from itself
- Equality of essence with itself lost in negation, negation predominates

### Chunk 18: Determining reflection — two sides: positedness and immanent reflection
**Lines**: 426-441
**Title**: Determining reflection — two sides: positedness and immanent reflection
**Key Points**:
- Two distinct sides: positedness (negation as such) and immanent reflection
- According to positedness: negation as negation, unity with itself (implicitly)
- Immediate which sublates itself within, other of itself
- Reflection is determining that abides in itself, essence does not exit
- Distinctions solely posited, taken back into essence
- From other side: reflected into themselves
- Negation as negation is equality with itself, not reflected into non-being

### Chunk 19: Determining reflection — nature as both
**Lines**: 443-482
**Title**: Determining reflection — nature as both
**Key Points**:
- Determination of reflection is both immanently reflected reference and positedness
- As positedness: negation as such, non-being as against essence
- As self-reference: reflected within itself
- Positedness is sublatedness of determination; immanent reflectedness is subsisting
- Positedness at same time immanent reflection: determinateness is reference to otherness
- Not quiescent determinateness, not separate from reference
- Determination is determinate side and reference to its negation
- Quality passes over into another; determination of reflection takes otherness back into itself
- Positedness, negation deflected into itself, unity of itself and its other
- Essentiality through this unity
- Positedness, negation, but as reflection into itself is sublatedness of positedness
- Infinite reference to itself
