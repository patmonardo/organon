# Foundation Idea Workbook (Part-A Introduction View)

Status: active
Scope: Part-A introduction-level architecture only
Authority: original source text files in this folder

## Authority + format lock (must persist)

- Contract reference: `WORKBOOK-CONTRACT-V1.md`
- This workbook markdown is the authoritative Knowledge Graph artifact for Idea-level structure in Foundation.
- Any generated Cypher/DB projection is derivative and non-authoritative.
- Future edits must preserve this exact section order and entry schema unless a migration is explicitly recorded in `Decision:` and applied repo-wide to all affected workbooks.

## Purpose

This workbook records the Part-A introduction framing for Foundation:

- chapter-level orientation,
- explicit first movement into Identity,
- transition intent toward Difference and Contradiction.

It also keeps the architectural presupposition explicit:

- a determination of reflection presupposes a determining reflective consciousness.
- in Foundation, this operates as a section-principle (not an axiom block).
- axiomatic fixation is deferred to Entity/Spectral theory stages.
- dialectic here advances from given concepts, not from mathematically constructed intuition.
- therefore Reflection theory in this section is methodological-principled, not formal-axiomatic.

It does **not** do detailed entry analysis for all parts; those are handled in dedicated part workbooks.

## Part policy (binding)

- Only Foundation Part A carries an Idea workbook.
- Foundation Part B and Part C do not get separate Idea workbooks.
- Part B/C are handled directly in their part workbooks and compiler contracts.

## Source map (Foundation)

- Chapter: `CHAPTER 2 — Foundation`
- Parts:
  - `A. IDENTITY`
  - `B. DIFFERENCE`
  - `C. CONTRADICTION`

## Part A Idea marker

Part A provides the introduction-anchored movement where reflection first appears as pure identity and as negative simplicity; this is the framing threshold for the rest of Foundation.

## Part decomposition for detailed study

- `A. IDENTITY` -> see `FOUNDATION-PART-A-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `B. DIFFERENCE` -> see `FOUNDATION-PART-B-V2-WORKBOOK.md`
- `C. CONTRADICTION` -> deferred to dedicated part workbook

## Session log

### Session: 2026-02-18

- Decision: create a local Foundation contract + workbook stack in this folder (intentional duplication for visibility).
- Decision: keep exactly one Foundation Idea workbook, bound to Part A only.
- Decision: prioritize contradiction-resolution readiness while preserving Identity-first textual order.
