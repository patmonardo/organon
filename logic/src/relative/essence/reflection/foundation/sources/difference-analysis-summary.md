- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `diff-1` | Introduction — difference as negativity of reflection | 6-12 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-2` | Absolute difference as simple | 14-47 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-3` | Difference in itself — unity with identity | 49-82 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-4` | Difference has both moments — diversity | 84-94 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-5` | Diversity — identity breaks apart | 98-121 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-6` | Diversity — moments not determined with respect to each other | 123-140 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-7` | Diversity — reflection becomes external, likeness and unlikeness | 142-208 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-8` | External reflection connects diversity — comparing | 210-231 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-9` | Likeness and unlikeness — separation and self-sublation | 233-274 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-10` | Negative unity — transition to opposition | 275-347 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-11` | Opposition — introduction | 351-370 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-12` | Moments of opposition — positedness reflected into itself | 372-392 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-13` | Positive and negative — determinations of opposition | 394-420 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-14` | Positive and negative as self-subsisting | 422-448 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `diff-15` | Three aspects: moments, diverse, in and for themselves | 450-594 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Three-part structure (absolute difference/diversity/opposition) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in positive and negative as in and for themselves

### Key Concepts
- **Absolute difference**: Negativity that reflection possesses in itself, simple difference, difference of essence
- **Difference in itself**: Difference that refers itself to itself, unity with identity, internally determined difference
- **Diversity**: Difference having both moments (identity and difference), identity breaking apart, reflection becoming external
- **Likeness and unlikeness**: External identity and difference, dependent on third, self-sublating
- **Negative unity**: Unity of likeness and unlikeness, transition to opposition
- **Opposition**: Unity of identity and diversity, determinate reflection brought to completion
- **Positive and negative**: Determinations of opposition, positedness reflected into self-likeness/unlikeness, self-subsisting, in and for themselves
- **Exclusive reference**: Reference to other, precisely as exclusive, constitutes determination or in-itselfness

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Continue with contradiction.txt and other Foundation/Ground section files
