/**
 * CONDITION: The Conclusion of Objective Qualitative Logic
 * =======================================================
 *
 * The final resolution where all ground-relationships sublate themselves
 * into the pure immediacy of CONCRETE EXISTENCE. This is the complete
 * logical structure governing the emergence of actuality from essence.
 *
 * The Logical Rules of Manifestation:
 * 1. Every ground presupposes conditions
 * 2. Every condition presupposes ground
 * 3. Ground and condition are one absolute totality
 * 4. When all conditions are present, the fact steps into existence
 * 5. This stepping-forth sublates both ground and condition
 * 6. Result: Immediate concrete existence as groundless ground
 *
 * Yogic Correspondence:
 * - PRATYAYA: Condition as conditioning factor
 * - NIMITTA: Instrumental cause as conditioning ground
 * - KARANA-KARYA: Complete cause-effect totality
 * - STHITI: The moment of manifestation when all conditions unite
 * - UTPATTI: Coming-forth into concrete existence
 * - SAT-ASAT-SADAKHYA: Being-Nonbeing-Appearance as complete cycle
 *
 * "When all the conditions of a fact are at hand, the fact steps into concrete existence"
 * "The fact proceeds from the ground... the truth of the grounding is that in grounding
 * the ground unites with itself" - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Two: Essence - Chapter 3, C. Condition
