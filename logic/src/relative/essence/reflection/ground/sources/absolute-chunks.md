## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: a. Form and essence — ground and grounded
**Lines**: 5-43
**Title**: a. Form and essence — ground and grounded
**Key Points**:
- Determination of reflection returns into ground
- First immediate existence from which beginning is made
- Existence has meaning of positedness, presupposes ground
- Positing is sublating of itself, immediate is posited, ground is non-posited
- Presupposing is positing that rebounds on that which posits
- Ground is essence determined through itself, as indeterminate or sublated positedness
- Essence in its negativity identical with itself
- Determinateness of essence as ground is twofold: ground and grounded
- Essence as ground: essence determined to be essence as against positedness, as non-positedness
- Grounded: immediate that is not anything in and for itself, positedness as positedness
- Positedness identical with itself, but in identity of negative with itself
- Self-identical negative and self-identical positive are one and same identity
- Ground is self-identity of positive or positedness
- Grounded is positedness as positedness, reflection-into-itself is identity of ground
- Simple identity is not itself ground
- As unity of determinate identity (ground) and negative identity (grounded), essence distinct from its mediation

### Chunk 2: Mediation of ground — unity of pure and determining reflection
**Lines**: 45-69
**Title**: Mediation of ground — unity of pure and determining reflection
**Key Points**:
- Mediation compared with preceding reflections
- Not pure reflection: undistinguished from essence, no negative, no self-subsistence of determinations
- Determinations have subsistence in ground understood as sublated reflection
- Not determining reflection: determinations have essential self-subsistence, but reflection foundered, sunk to ground
- In unity of ground, determinations are only posited determinations
- Mediation of ground is unity of pure reflection and determining reflection
- Determinations or posited have self-subsistence
- Self-subsistence of determinations is posited subsistence
- Since subsistence of determinations is itself posited or has determinateness
- Determinations distinguished from simple identity
- They constitute form as against essence

### Chunk 3: Essence has form — substrate and movement
**Lines**: 71-101
**Title**: Essence has form — substrate and movement
**Key Points**:
- Essence has form and determinations of this form
- Only as ground does it have fixed immediacy or is substrate
- Essence as such is one with its reflection, inseparable from its movement
- Not essence through which movement runs its reflective course
- Nor essence that from which movement begins
- This makes exposition of reflection especially difficult
- Cannot say essence returns into itself, essence shines in itself
- Essence is neither before its movement nor in the movement
- Movement has no substrate on which it runs its course
- Term of reference arises in ground only following moment of sublated reflection
- Essence as referred-to term is determinate essence
- By virtue of positedness it has form as essence
- Determinations of form are determinations in essence
- Essence lies at their foundation as indeterminate, indifferent to them
- In it, they are reflected into themselves
- Determinations of reflection should have subsistence in them and be self-subsistent
- But self-subsistence is their dissolution, which they have in other
- This dissolution is self-identity or ground of subsistence they give to themselves

### Chunk 4: Form determinations — everything determinate belongs to form
**Lines**: 103-137
**Title**: Form determinations — everything determinate belongs to form
**Key Points**:
- Everything determinate belongs in general to form
- Form determination is something posited, distinguished from that of which it is form
- As quality, determinateness is one with substrate, being
- Being is immediate determinate, not yet distinct from determinateness
- Form determinations of essence are previously considered moments of reflections
- Identity and difference, latter as diversity and opposition
- Ground-connection belongs among form determinations
- Through it, essence is at same time as posited
- Identity that has ground immanent in it does not pertain to form
- Positedness as sublated (as ground and grounded) is one reflection
- This reflection constitutes essence as simple substrate which is subsistence of form
- But in ground this subsistence is posited
- Essence is itself essentially as determinate, is moment of ground-connection and form
- Absolute reciprocal connecting reference of form and essence
- Essence is simple unity of ground and grounded
- But in this unity, is itself determined, is negative
- Distinguishes itself as substrate from form
- But at same time becomes itself ground and moment of form

### Chunk 5: Form as completed whole — absolute negativity
**Lines**: 139-189
**Title**: Form as completed whole — absolute negativity
**Key Points**:
- Form is completed whole of reflection
- Contains determination of reflection that it is sublated
- One unity of its determining
- Referred to its sublatedness, to another that is not itself form but in which form is
- As essential self-referring negativity, form is positing and determining
- Simple essence is indeterminate and inert substrate
- Determinations of form have subsistence or reflection into themselves in it
- External reflection halts at distinction of essence and form
- Distinction is necessary, but distinguishing itself of two is their unity
- Unity of ground is essence repelling itself from itself and making itself into positedness
- Form is absolute negativity itself or negative absolute self-identity
- By virtue of which essence is not being but essence
- Identity, taken abstractly, is essence as against form
- Negativity, taken abstractly as positedness, is one determination of form
- But this determination is whole self-referring negativity
- Which within, as this identity, is simple essence
- Form has essence in its own identity, essence has absolute form in its negative nature
- Cannot ask how form comes to essence
- Form is only internal reflective shining of essence, its own reflection inhabiting it
- Form equally is reflection turning back into itself or identical essence
- In its determining, form makes determination into positedness as positedness
- Form does not determine essence as if truly presupposed, separate from essence
- Form is itself ground of its sublating or identical reference of its determinations
- Form determines essence: in distinguishing sublates distinguishing
- Is self-identity that essence is as subsistence of determinations
- Form is contradiction of being sublated in positedness and yet having subsistence in sublatedness
- Ground as essence self-identical in being determined or negated

### Chunk 6: Form determines essence — matter
**Lines**: 191-202
**Title**: Form determines essence — matter
**Key Points**:
- Distinctions of form and essence are only moments of simple reference of form itself
- Must be examined and fixed more closely
- Determining form refers itself to itself as sublated positedness
- Refers itself to its identity as to another
- Posits itself as sublated, therefore presupposes its identity
- According to this moment, essence is indeterminate to which form is other
- Not essence which is absolute reflection within
- But essence determined as formless identity: it is matter

### Chunk 7: b. Form and matter — essence becomes matter
**Lines**: 206-228
**Title**: b. Form and matter — essence becomes matter
**Key Points**:
- Essence becomes matter in that its reflection is determined as relating itself to essence as to formless indeterminate
- Matter is simple identity, void of distinction, that essence is
- With determination that it is other of form
- Proper base or substrate of form
- Constitutes immanent reflection of determinations of form
- Self-subsistent term to which determinations refer as to their positive subsistence
- If abstraction made from every determination, from every form, matter is what is left over
- Matter is absolutely abstract
- Cannot see, feel, etc. matter; what one sees or feels is determinate matter, unity of matter and form
- Abstraction from which matter derives is not external removal and sublation of form
- Form itself reduces itself by virtue of itself to this simple identity

### Chunk 8: Form and matter presuppose each other — reciprocal reference
**Lines**: 230-296
**Title**: Form and matter presuppose each other — reciprocal reference
**Key Points**:
- Form presupposes matter to which it refers
- Two do not find themselves confronting each other externally and accidentally
- Neither matter nor form derives from itself, is a se, is eternal
- Matter is indifferent with respect to form
- Indifference is determinateness of self-identity to which form returns as to substrate
- Form presupposes matter because posits itself as sublated, refers to its identity as to something other
- Contrariwise, form is presupposed by matter
- Matter is not simple essence which immediately is absolute reflection
- But essence determined as something positive, only is as sublated negation
- Since form posits itself as matter only in sublating itself, matter is determined as groundless subsistence
- Matter is not determined as ground of form
- Matter posits itself as abstract identity of sublated determination of form
- It is not that identity as ground, form is groundless with respect to it
- Form and matter alike determined as not to be posited each by other, each not to be ground of other
- Matter is identity of ground and grounded, as substrate that stands over against reference of form
- Determination of indifference that two have in common is determination of matter as such
- Also constitutes their reciprocal reference
- Matter, determined as indifferent, is passive as contrasted to form, which is active
- Form as self-referring negative is inherently contradiction, self-dissolving, self-repelling, self-determining
- Refers to matter, which is its subsistence, as to another
- Matter is posited as referring only to itself and as indifferent to other
- But implicitly refers to form, contains sublated negativity
- Is matter only by virtue of this determination
- Refers to form as other only because form not posited in it, form only implicitly
- Contains form locked up inside it
- Absolute receptivity for form only because has form within it absolutely
- To be form is its implicit vocation
- Matter must be informed, form must materialize itself
- Form must give itself self-identity or subsistence in matter

### Chunk 9: Form determines matter — self-mediation
**Lines**: 298-311
**Title**: Form determines matter — self-mediation
**Key Points**:
- Form determines matter, matter is determined by form
- Because form is absolute self-identity and implicitly contains matter
- And equally because matter in pure abstraction or absolute negativity possesses form within it
- Activity of form on matter and reception by matter of form determination
- Is only sublating of semblance of their indifference and distinctness
- Determination referring each to other is self-mediation of each through its own non-being
- Two mediations are one movement
- Restoration of their original identity is inner recollection of their exteriorization

### Chunk 10: Form and matter presuppose each other — absolute ground
**Lines**: 313-323
**Title**: Form and matter presuppose each other — absolute ground
**Key Points**:
- First, form and matter presuppose each other
- This only means one essential unity is negative self-reference
- Therefore splits, determined as indifferent substrate in essential identity
- And as determining form in essential distinction or negativity
- That unity of essence and form, two opposed as form and matter, is absolute self-determining ground
- Inasmuch as unity differentiates itself
- Reference connecting two diverse terms, because of unity underlying them
- Becomes reference of reciprocal presupposition

### Chunk 11: Form self-sublating — two sides
**Lines**: 325-349
**Title**: Form self-sublating — two sides
**Key Points**:
- Second, form already is, as self-subsisting, self-sublating contradiction
- Also posited as in this way self-sublating
- Self-subsisting and at same time essentially referred to another, consequently sublates itself
- Since two-sided, sublating also has two sides
- For one, form sublates its self-subsistence and transforms itself into something posited
- Something that exists in other, and this other is matter
- For other, form sublates its determinateness vis-à-vis matter
- Sublates its reference to it, consequently its positedness
- Thereby gives itself subsistence
- Reflection in sublating positedness is its own identity into which it passes over
- But since form at same time externalizes this identity and posits it over against itself as matter
- Reflection of positedness into itself is union with matter in which it obtains subsistence
- In this union, equally both: united with matter as with something other
- And in this other, united with its own identity

### Chunk 12: Activity of form — matter's movement
**Lines**: 351-393
**Title**: Activity of form — matter's movement
**Key Points**:
- Activity of form by which matter is determined consists in negative relating of form to itself
- But conversely, form thereby negatively relates itself to matter also
- Movement by which matter becomes determined is just as much form's own movement
- Form is free of matter, but sublates its self-subsistence
- Its self-subsistence is matter itself, for in matter it has its essential identity
- Makes itself into positedness, but this is same as making matter into something determinate
- But from other side, form's own identity is at same time externalized
- Matter is its other
- Because form sublates its own self-subsistence, matter is also not determined
- But matter only subsists vis-à-vis form
- As negative sublates itself, so does positive also
- As form sublates itself, determinateness of matter vis-à-vis form falls away
- What appears as activity of form is just as much movement that belongs to matter itself
- Determination that implicitly exists in matter, what matter is supposed to be, is its absolute negativity
- Through it matter does not just refer to form as to other
- But external other is form that matter itself contains locked up within itself
- Matter is in itself same contradiction that form contains
- Contradiction, like its resolution, is only one
- Matter is in itself self-contradictory because, as indeterminate self-identity, is at same time absolute negativity
- Sublates itself within: identity disintegrates in negativity while latter obtains in it its subsistence
- Since matter determined by form as by something external, attains its determination
- Externality of relating, for both form and matter, consists in that each, or original unity of each
- In positing is at same time presupposing
- Result: self-reference is at same time reference to self as sublated or reference to its other

### Chunk 13: Original unity restored — content
**Lines**: 395-457
**Title**: Original unity restored — content
**Key Points**:
- Third, through movement of form and matter, original unity restored
- On other hand, henceforth posited unity
- Matter is just as much self-determining as determining is for it activity of form external to it
- Contrariwise, form determines only itself, or has matter that it determines within it
- Just as much in its determining relates itself to another
- Activity of form and movement of matter are one and same thing
- Former is activity, negativity as posited
- Latter is movement or becoming, negativity as determination existing in itself
- Result is unity of in-itself and positedness
- Matter is as such determined or necessarily has form
- Form is simply material, subsistent form
- Inasmuch as form presupposes matter as its other, it is finite
- Not ground but only active factor
- Matter, inasmuch as presupposes form as its non-being, is finite matter
- Not ground of its unity with form but for latter only substrate
- Neither finite matter nor finite form have truth
- Each refers to other, or only their unity is their truth
- Two determinations return to unity and there sublate their self-subsistence
- Unity proves to be their ground
- Matter is ground of its form determination not as matter but only as absolute unity of essence and form
- Similarly, form is ground only as that same one unity
- One unity, as absolute negativity, exclusive unity, is in its reflection a presupposing
- Unity is one act: preserving itself as positedness in positing, repelling itself from itself
- Referring itself to itself as itself and to itself as another
- Act by which matter determined by form is self-mediation of essence as ground, in one unity
- Through itself and through negation of itself
- Informed matter or form that possesses subsistence is absolute unity of ground with itself
- But also unity as posited
- Movement is one in which absolute ground exhibited its moments at once as self-sublating and consequently as posited
- Restored unity, in withdrawing into itself, repelled itself from itself and determined itself
- Unity established through negation, therefore also negative unity
- Unity of form and matter, as substrate of both, but substrate which is determinate
- Formed matter, but matter at same time indifferent to form and matter
- Indifferent to them because sublated and unessential
- This is content

### Chunk 14: c. Form and content — form stands over against content
**Lines**: 461-475
**Title**: c. Form and content — form stands over against content
**Key Points**:
- Form stands at first over against essence
- It is then ground-connection in general, determinations are ground and grounded
- It then stands over against matter
- So it is determining reflection, determinations are determination of reflection itself and subsistence of latter
- Finally, it stands over against content
- Then its determinations are again itself and matter
- What was previously self-identical: at first ground, then subsistence in general, finally matter
- Now passes under dominion of form and is once more one of its determinations

### Chunk 15: Content has form and matter — unity
**Lines**: 477-502
**Title**: Content has form and matter — unity
**Key Points**:
- Content has, first, form and matter that belong to it essentially; it is their unity
- But because unity is at same time determinate or posited unity, content stands over against form
- Latter constitutes positedness and is unessential over against content
- Content indifferent towards form
- Form embraces both form as such as well as matter
- Content has form and matter, of which it constitutes substrate
- Which are to it mere positedness
- Content is, second, what is identical in form and matter
- So that these would be only indifferent external determinations
- They are positedness in general, but positedness that has returned in content to its unity or its ground
- Identity of content with itself is, in one respect, identity indifferent to form
- But in another, identity of ground
- Ground has at first disappeared into content
- But content is at same time negative reflection of form determinations into themselves
- Its unity, at first only unity indifferent to form, is therefore also formal unity or ground-connection as such
- Content has this ground-connection as its essential form
- Contrariwise, ground has a content

### Chunk 16: Content of ground — determinate ground
**Lines**: 504-535
**Title**: Content of ground — determinate ground
**Key Points**:
- Content of ground is ground that has returned into its unity with itself
- Ground is at first essence that in its positedness is identical with itself
- As diverse from and indifferent to its positedness, ground is indeterminate matter
- But as content it is at same time informed identity
- This form becomes for this reason ground-connection
- Since determinations of its oppositions are posited in content also as negated
- Content is further determined within, not like matter as indifferent in general
- But like informed matter, so that determinations of form have material, indifferent subsistence
- On one hand, content is essential self-identity of ground in its positedness
- On other hand, it is posited identity as against ground-connection
- This positedness, which is in this identity as determination of form
- Stands over against free positedness, form as whole connection of ground and grounded
- This form is total positedness returning into itself
- Other form is only positedness as immediate, determinateness as such
- Ground has made itself into determinate ground in general
- Determinateness is itself twofold: of form first, and of content second
- Former is determinateness of being external to content as such
- Content that remains indifferent to this external reference
- Latter is determinateness of content that ground has
