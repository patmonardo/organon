# Source Analysis Summary: condition.txt

**Date**: Source analysis completed
**Status**: ✓ VERIFIED - Chunks match source text exactly

## Analysis Results

### Coverage
- **Total Source Lines**: 528
- **Chunks Extracted**: 16
- **Coverage**: 100% of substantive text
- **Gaps**: None (only blank lines and headers excluded, as expected)

### Chunk Verification

| Chunk ID | Title | Source Lines | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `con-1` | a. The relatively unconditioned — condition as immediate | 6-14 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-2` | Condition — three moments | 22-71 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-3` | Something has condition and ground | 73-113 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-4` | Two sides — indifferent and mediated | 115-146 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-5` | b. The absolutely unconditioned — reflective shine | 150-156 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-6` | Condition's form — two moments | 158-180 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-7` | Condition as whole form — ground | 182-208 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-8` | Conditioned ground — whole itself | 210-224 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-9` | One whole of form and content | 226-242 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-10` | One essential unity — absolutely unconditioned | 244-273 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-11` | Absolutely unconditioned — fact in itself | 275-307 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-12` | c. Procession — absolutely unconditioned as absolute ground | 311-319 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-13` | Conditions — totality of determinations | 320-380 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-14` | Ground-connection — form | 382-438 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-15` | All conditions at hand — concrete existence | 440-489 | ✓ VERIFIED |
| `con-16` | Fact proceeds from ground — concrete existence | 491-527 | ✓ VERIFIED |

### Text Matching
- ✓ All chunk text matches source text exactly
- ✓ No discrepancies found
- ✓ Proper paragraph boundaries maintained

### Logical Flow
- ✓ Chunks represent complete logical thoughts
- ✓ Dialectical progression is coherent
- ✓ Transitions between chunks are clear
- ✓ Three-part structure (relatively unconditioned/absolutely unconditioned/procession) properly captured
- ✓ Culminates appropriately in concrete existence

### Key Concepts
- **Condition**: Immediate to which ground refers as to its essential presupposition, immediate manifold existence, constitutes presupposition of ground, in-itself of ground
- **Relatively unconditioned**: Condition and ground indifferent and unconditioned, also mediated, each side contradiction of independent subsistence and being determined as moments
- **Absolutely unconditioned**: One essential unity of condition and ground, fact in itself, contains both as moments, relation disappeared, reduced to reflective shine
- **Procession**: Absolutely unconditioned as absolute ground identical with condition, conditions as totality of determinations, ground-connection as form, all conditions at hand, fact steps into concrete existence
- **Concrete existence**: Immediacy mediated by ground and condition, self-identical through sublating of mediation, fact proceeds from ground, ground unites with itself, fact is unconditioned and groundless

### Recommendations
- ✓ No issues found
- ✓ Chunking is complete and accurate
- ✓ Ready for logical operation analysis

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Source analysis complete
2. ✓ Chunks verified against source
3. → Proceed with logical operation refinement if needed
4. → Ground section complete! All Reflection section files analyzed
