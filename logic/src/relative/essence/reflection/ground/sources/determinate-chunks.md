## Chunk Details

### Chunk 1: a. Formal ground — determinate content
**Lines**: 6-17
**Title**: a. Formal ground — determinate content
**Key Points**:
- Ground has determinate content
- For form, determinateness of content is substrate, simple immediate as against mediation of form
- Ground is negatively self-referring identity
- Makes itself into positedness
- Negatively refers to itself because in its negativity identical with itself
- This identity is substrate or content
- Constitutes indifferent or positive unity of ground-connection
- In this connection, is mediating factor

### Chunk 2: Formal mediation — negative and positive unity
**Lines**: 19-44
**Title**: Formal mediation — negative and positive unity
**Key Points**:
- In content, determinateness that ground and grounded have over against one another has at first disappeared
- Mediation is also negative unity
- Negative implicit in indifferent substrate is substrate's immediate determinateness
- Through which ground has determinate content
- Negative is negative reference of form to itself
- What has been posited sublates itself and returns to ground
- Ground refers negatively to itself and makes itself into positedness
- Negative mediation of ground and grounded is mediation that belongs to form as such, formal mediation
- Both sides of form, because each passes over into other, mutually posit themselves into one identity as sublated
- Presuppose identity
- Latter is determinate content to which formal mediation refers itself through itself as to positive mediating factor
- Content is identical element of both
- Because two are distinct, yet in distinction each is reference to other
- It is their subsistence, subsistence of each as whole itself

### Chunk 3: Determinate ground — ground and grounded
**Lines**: 46-76
**Title**: Determinate ground — ground and grounded
**Key Points**:
- In determinate ground: first, determinate content considered from two sides
- Once in so far as it is ground, then again in so far as it is grounded
- Content itself indifferent to these forms, in each simply and solely one determination
- Second, ground is itself just as much moment of form as what is posited by it
- Identity according to form
- Matter of indifference which determination is made first
- Whether transition from one as posited to other as ground or from one as ground to other as posited
- Grounded, considered for itself, is sublating of itself
- Makes itself into posited, and is at same time positing of ground
- Same movement is ground as such
- Makes itself into something posited, thereby becomes ground of something
- Present therein both as posited and also first as ground
- That there be ground, of that posited is ground, and conversely ground is posited
- Mediation begins just as much from one as from other
- Each side is just as much ground as posited, and each is whole mediation or whole form
- Whole form is itself, as self-identical, substrate of two determinations
- Form and content are themselves one and same identity

### Chunk 4: Ground is sufficient — formal ground
**Lines**: 78-103
**Title**: Ground is sufficient — formal ground
**Key Points**:
- Because of identity of ground and grounded, according both to content and form
- Ground is sufficient (sufficiency limited to this relation)
- Nothing in grounded which is not in ground
- When one asks for ground, expects to see same determination which is content doubled
- Once in form of that which is posited, again in form of existence reflected into itself, of essentiality
- In determined ground, ground and grounded are each whole form, and their content, though determinate, is one and same
- Two sides do not have real determination, do not have different content
- Determinateness is only one simple determinateness that has yet to pass over into two sides
- Determinate ground present only in pure form, as formal ground
- Because content is only simple determinateness, one that does not have in it form of ground-connection
- Determinateness is self-identical content indifferent to form
- Form is external to it, content is other than form

### Chunk 5: b. Real ground — diverse content
**Lines**: 107-133
**Title**: b. Real ground — diverse content
**Key Points**:
- Determinateness of ground is, on one hand, determinateness of substrate or content determination
- On other hand, otherness in ground-connection itself, distinctness of content and form
- Connection of ground and grounded strays in content as external form
- Content is indifferent to these determinations
- But in fact two are not external to each other
- Content is: identity of ground with itself in grounded, and of grounded in ground
- Side of ground has shown itself to be itself posited
- Side of grounded to be itself ground
- Each side is identity of whole within it
- But since they equally belong to form and constitute its determinate difference
- Each is in its determinateness identity of whole with itself
- Consequently, each has diverse content as against other
- Or, from side of content, since latter is self-identity of ground-connection
- It essentially possesses difference of form within
- Is as ground something other than what it is as grounded

### Chunk 6: Ground realized — no longer tautology
**Lines**: 135-142
**Title**: Ground realized — no longer tautology
**Key Points**:
- Moment ground and grounded have diverse content
- Ground-connection has ceased to be formal one
- Turning back to ground and procession forward from ground to posited is no longer tautology
- Ground is realized
- Henceforth, when we ask for ground, we actually demand another content determination for it
- Than determination of content whose ground we are asking for

### Chunk 7: Connection determines itself — twofold content
**Lines**: 144-163
**Title**: Connection determines itself — twofold content
**Key Points**:
- Connection determines itself further
- Inasmuch as two sides are of different content, they are indifferent to each other
- Each is immediate, self-identical determination
- As referred to each other as ground and grounded
- Ground reflects itself in other, as in something posited by it, back to itself
- Content on side of ground is equally in grounded
- Latter, as posited, has self-identity and subsistence only in ground
- But besides content of ground, grounded also possesses content of its own
- Is accordingly unity of twofold content
- Unity, as unity of sides that are different, is indeed their negative unity
- But since two determinations of content are indifferent to each other
- Unity is only empty reference to each other, in itself void of content, not their mediation
- It is one or something externally holding them together

### Chunk 8: Real grounding connection — twofold
**Lines**: 165-205
**Title**: Real grounding connection — twofold
**Key Points**:
- In real grounding connection there is present a twofold
- For one thing, content determination which is ground extends continuously into positedness
- So that it constitutes simple identity of ground and grounded
- Grounded contains ground fully within itself
- Connection is one of undifferentiated essential compactness
- Anything else in grounded added to simple essence is only unessential form
- External determinations of content that are free from ground
- Constitute immediate manifold
- Of unessential more, essential is not ground
- Nor ground of any connection between it and unessential in grounded
- Unessential is positively identical element that resides in grounded but does not posit itself in distinctive form
- As self-referring content, indifferent positive substrate
- For another thing, that which in something is linked with substrate is indifferent content, but as unessential side
- Main thing is connection of substrate and unessential manifold
- But this connection, since determinations it connects are indifferent content, is also not ground
- One determination determined as essential content and other as only unessential or posited
- But this form is to each, as self-referring content, external one
- One of something that constitutes their connection is not reference of form
- But only external tie that does not hold unessential manifold content as posited
- It too is therefore likewise only substrate

### Chunk 9: Ground breaks down — external ground
**Lines**: 207-229
**Title**: Ground breaks down — external ground
**Key Points**:
- Ground, in determining itself as real, because of diversity of content that constitutes its reality
- Thus breaks down into external determinations
- Two connections: essential reality content as simple immediate identity of ground and grounded
- And something connecting distinct contents are two different substrates
- Self-identical form of ground, according to which one and same thing is at one time essential and at another posited, has vanished
- Ground-connection has become external to itself
- Consequently, external ground that holds together diversified content
- Determines what is ground and what is posited by it
- Determination not found in two-sided content itself
- Real ground is reference to another
- On one hand, of content to another content
- On other, of ground-connection itself (form) to another, namely to immediate, to something not posited by it

### Chunk 10: c. Complete ground — real ground returns to ground
**Lines**: 233-254
**Title**: c. Complete ground — real ground returns to ground
**Key Points**:
- In real ground, ground as content and ground as connection are only substrates
- Former only posited as essential and as ground
- Connection is what grounded immediately is as indeterminate substrate of diversified content
- Linking of content which is not content's own reflection but external, reflection which is only posited
- Real ground-connection is ground rather as sublated
- Makes up side of grounded or of positedness
- As positedness, ground itself has returned to its ground
- Is now something grounded: it has another ground
- This ground determined: first, identical with ground by which it is grounded
- Both sides have one and same content
- Two content determinations and their linkage in something equally found in new ground
- Second, new ground into which previously merely posited and external link is sublated
- Is immanent reflection of this link: absolute reference of two content determinations to each other

### Chunk 11: Complete ground — formal and real
**Lines**: 256-263
**Title**: Complete ground — formal and real
**Key Points**:
- Because real ground has returned to its ground
- Identity of ground and grounded or formality of ground reasserts itself
- Newly arisen ground-connection is one which is complete
- Contains formal and real ground in itself at same time
- Mediates content determinations which in real ground confronted each other immediately

### Chunk 12: Ground-connection determined — first and second
**Lines**: 265-306
**Title**: Ground-connection determined — first and second
**Key Points**:
- First, something has ground
- Contains content determination which is ground and, in addition, second determination as posited by ground
- But because of indifference of content, one determination is not ground in itself
- Nor other in itself one that is grounded by first
- Connection of ground and grounded sublated in immediacy of content, is posited
- As such has its ground in another such connection
- Since second connection distinguished only according to form, has same content as first
- Still has same two determinations of content but now their immediate linking together
- Linking is of general nature, content diversified into determinations indifferent to each other
- Linking is not their true absolute connection
- Two are supported by something, something connects them
- But in connection which is not reflected, only immediate, only relative ground
- Two somethings are two distinct connections of content
- Stand in identical ground-connection of form
- One and same whole content: two content determinations and their connection
- Distinct only by kind of connection, which in one is immediate and in other posited connection
- Distinguished as ground and grounded only according to form

### Chunk 13: Ground-connection also real — inference
**Lines**: 307-359
**Title**: Ground-connection also real — inference
**Key Points**:
- Second, ground-connection is not only formal, but also real
- Formal ground passes over into real ground
- Moments of form reflect themselves into themselves
- Are self-subsistent content
- Ground-connection contains one content with character of ground and another with that of grounded
- Content constitutes immediate identity of both sides of formal ground
- Two sides have one and same content
- But content also has form in it, so it is twofold content that behaves as ground and grounded
- One of two content determinations of two somethings determined as their identical substrate and foundation of connection
- As against other determination, this determination is essential and is ground of other which is posited
- In first something (ground-connection), second determination also immediately and in itself linked with first
- Other something only contains one determination in itself as that in which immediately identical with first something
- But other as one which is posited in it
- Former content determination is its ground by virtue of being originally linked in first something with other content determination
- Ground-connection of content determinations in second something is mediated through connection present in first something
- Inference: since determination B is implicitly linked with determination A in something
- In second something to which only determination A immediately belongs, also B is linked with it
- In second something, not only is second determination mediated
- Also mediated is that its immediate ground is mediated, by virtue of original connection with B in first something
- This connection is ground of ground A
- Whole ground-connection present in second something as posited or grounded

### Chunk 14: Complete mediation — conditioning
**Lines**: 361-396
**Title**: Complete mediation — conditioning
**Key Points**:
- Real ground shows itself to be self-external reflection of ground
- Its complete mediation is restoration of its identity with itself
- But because identity has equally acquired externality of real ground
- Formal ground-connection in unity of itself and real ground is just as much self-positing as self-sublating ground
- Ground-connection mediates itself with itself through its negation
- Ground is at first, as original connection, connection of immediate content determinations
- Ground-connection, being essential form, has for sides such that are sublated or are moments
- As form of immediate determinations, connects itself with itself as self-identical
- While at same time connecting with their negation
- Ground not in and for itself but as connected with sublated ground-connection
- Second, sublated connection or immediate, which in original and posited connection is identical substrate
- Is likewise real ground not in and for itself
- That it is ground is posited by virtue of original link
- Ground-connection is in its totality essentially presupposing reflection
- Formal ground presupposes immediate content determination
- Content presupposes form as real ground
- Ground is form as immediate linkage but repels itself from itself
- Rather presupposes immediacy, referring itself therein as to another
- Immediate is content determination, simple ground
- But as ground, equally repelled from itself and refers itself to itself equally as to other
- Total ground-connection has taken on determination of conditioning mediation
