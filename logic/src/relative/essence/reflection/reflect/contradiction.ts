/**
 * CONTRADICTION (VIRODHA → NIRODHA): The Resolution of Opposition
 * ===============================================================
 *
 * Contradiction as the culmination and resolution of the Determinations of Reflection.
 * This is where VIRODHA (opposition) leads to its own NIRODHA (cessation/resolution).
 * The yogi "Nirodhas the Virodha" - transcends opposition through recognizing
 * its self-contradictory nature, leading to GROUND as the new starting point.
 *
 * Connection to Yoga:
 * - VIRODHA (विरोध): Opposition/contradiction in CITTA
 * - NIRODHA (निरोध): Cessation/resolution of opposition
 * - DHYANA prepares CITTA for SAMADHI through resolving contradictions
 * - SAMADHI: The contradiction-free starting point
 * - SAMYAMA: The fully developed unity beyond all opposition
 *
 * "Difference as such is already implicitly contradiction...
 * The positive and the negative, however, are the posited contradiction"
 * - Hegel
 *
 * Based on Hegel's Logic Book Two: Essence - Chapter 2, C. Contradiction
