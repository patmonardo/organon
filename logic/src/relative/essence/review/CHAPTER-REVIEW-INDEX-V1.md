# Chapter Review Index (V1)

Status: active
Purpose: schedule and track chapter-level review passes without overmarking core workbooks.
Scope: `reflection` + `appearance`

## Review policy

- Keep review notes in this `review/` tree only.
- Do not add review markup directly into core Part/Idea workbooks during this pass.
- Use chapter-level checkpoints first; defer line-level rewrites to approved follow-up passes.

## Planned chapter review workbooks

### Reflection

- [ ] `reflection/REFLECTION-GROUND-CHAPTER-REVIEW-V1.md`
- [ ] `reflection/REFLECTION-ESSENCE-CHAPTER-REVIEW-V1.md`
- [ ] `reflection/REFLECTION-FOUNDATION-CHAPTER-REVIEW-V1.md`

### Appearance

- [ ] `appearance/APPEARANCE-THING-CHAPTER-REVIEW-V1.md`
- [ ] `appearance/APPEARANCE-WORLD-CHAPTER-REVIEW-V1.md`
- [ ] `appearance/APPEARANCE-RELATION-CHAPTER-REVIEW-V1.md`

## Standard review rubric (chapter pass)

- Boundary integrity: decomposition boundaries still match source markers and sentence groups.
- Claim quality: minimal, non-redundant, and line-anchored claims.
- Relation coherence: transitions/support/refines links are semantically correct across part boundaries.
- Idea/part separation: chapter and section ideas remain in Idea workbooks, not mixed into Part extraction.
- Handoff quality: end-of-part transitions correctly target next part/chapter.

## Session note

- Current phase: create review workbooks and schedule first pass sequence.
- Proposed sequence: `Reflection/Ground+Essence+Foundation -> Appearance/Relation -> Appearance/Thing+World -> cross-domain continuity`.
