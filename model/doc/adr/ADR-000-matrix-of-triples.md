# ADR-000: Matrix of Triples and EssenceGraph for ORGANON Platform

## Context

The ORGANON platform is architected as a dialectical semantic pipeline, structured around triples (triads) that recursively descend through layers of logic, modeling, and action. This recursive descent is complemented by an ascent—a fivefold synthesis—where each traversal of the triplet chain is unified into a higher-order structure.

## Outline & Pattern

- **Recursive Descent:**  
  The platform’s semantic flow moves from abstract principle to concrete action through a series of triples:
  - **Logic (BEC):** Being → Essence → Concept
  - **Model (MVC):** Model → View → Controller
  - **Action (TAW):** Task → Agent → Workflow

- **Fivefold Synthesis:**  
  The ascent integrates these triples into a unified whole, synthesizing the recursive traversal into a single, organic system.

- **EssenceGraph:**  
  The underlying graph system—termed **EssenceGraph**—models the relationships, traversals, and syntheses of these triples. Each node and edge in the graph represents a dialectical moment or transformation, enabling both analytic decomposition and generative synthesis.

## Matrix of Triples

| Logic (BEC)         | Model (MVC)         | Action (TAW)         | Notes / Relation                |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Being               | Model               | Task                 | Principle → Structure → Action  |
| Essence             | View                | Agent                | Quality → Representation → Actor|
| Concept             | Controller          | Workflow             | Unity → Rule → Process          |
| Shape               | State               | Goal                 | Form → Condition → Objective    |
| Context             | Perspective         | Capacity             | Ground → Viewpoint → Ability    |
| Morph               | Action              | Method               | Self-Relation → Activity → Means|
| Entity              | Data                | Event                | Determinate → Information → Occurrence |
| Property            | Attribute           | Condition            | Measure → Feature → Prerequisite|
| Relation            | Link                | Transition           | Tie → Connection → Change       |

## Usage

- Each row is a triple spanning Logic, Model, and Action.
- The matrix serves as both a checklist and a blueprint for documenting and formalizing the dialectical relationships in the platform.
- The **EssenceGraph** provides the computational and conceptual infrastructure for traversing, synthesizing, and extending these triples.

## Next Steps

- Expand each triple into its own ADR or concept document, detailing its recursive descent and role in the fivefold synthesis.
- Formalize the EssenceGraph as the core graph system for semantic traversal and synthesis.
