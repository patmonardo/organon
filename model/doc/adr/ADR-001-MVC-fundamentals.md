# ADR-001: MVC Theory in ORGANON Platform

## Status
Draft

## Context

The MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern is central to both software architecture and mathematical thinking. However, its philosophical and mathematical foundations are often misunderstood or oversimplified. In mathematical contexts (e.g., R), a "formula" is sometimes called a model, but this conflates the axiomatic logic of a model with its structural and semantic instantiation.

## Decision

We adopt a rigorous, dialectical approach to MVC Theory, distinguishing three foundational components:

### 1. General Model Theory

- **Purpose:** Studies the structure, semantics, and instantiation of models.
- **In ORGANON:** Abstract concepts (from BEC) are transformed into concrete, actionable models. The model is not just a formula or set of equations, but a semantic structure that embodies principles, relationships, and constraints.

### 2. General View Theory

- **Purpose:** Examines representation, perspective, and rendering of models.
- **In ORGANON:** Views are not mere visualizations; they are perspectives and interfaces that adapt models for different contexts, users, and GUIs. View Theory addresses how meaning is presented and interpreted.

### 3. General Control Theory

- **Purpose:** Focuses on rules, actions, and process orchestration.
- **In ORGANON:** Controllers manage user actions, workflows, and the dynamic logic of the app. Control Theory formalizes the rules and processes that govern transitions and interactions.

## Rationale

- **Mathematics and MVC:** While mathematical thinking underpins MVC, we recognize its limitations. A formula is part of the logic of a model, but not the whole model. True Model Theory integrates axiomatic foundations with semantic and structural instantiation.
- **Philosophical Precision:** By grounding MVC in dialectical logic and separating model, view, and control theories, we achieve greater clarity and extensibility.
- **Adapters and Extensions:** Adapters allow domain-specific extensions, translating abstract MVC structures into specialized KB Apps and GUIs.

## Consequences

- The platform supports rigorous, extensible MVC design, informed by both mathematical and philosophical principles.
- Adapters and middleware can be developed for any domain, without conflating formulas with models.
- The architecture is ready for advanced GenAI integration, semantic pipelines, and knowledge-based app development.
