# Strategic Positioning: BI as Secondary in AI Platform

## The Key Insight

**We're not competing with Looker/Malloy on their terms.**

### Looker/Malloy: Pure BI Platforms

**Their challenge:**
- ❌ Pure BI platforms
- ❌ Being disrupted by AI agents
- ❌ Need to add AI capabilities
- ❌ BI is their primary focus

**They're vulnerable:**
- AI agents can query data directly
- AI agents can generate visualizations
- AI agents can answer questions
- **They're more challenged by AI than we are**

### Us: BI as Secondary in AI Platform

**Our advantage:**
- ✅ BI is **secondary** within an AI platform
- ✅ **Entirely Agential** - agents are primary
- ✅ AI platform is the foundation
- ✅ BI leverages AI capabilities

**We're positioned differently:**
- AI agents are the primary interface
- BI is a secondary target (empirical concepts)
- Agents can use BI, but don't depend on it
- We're not a pure BI platform

## Architecture Comparison

### Looker/Malloy (Pure BI)

```
BI Platform
    ↓
Users query data
    ↓
Visualizations
    ↓
Dashboards
```

**Challenge:** AI agents can bypass this entirely

### Us (BI as Secondary in AI Platform)

```
AI Platform (Primary)
    ├─ GDSL (Graph/ML)
    ├─ Logic (Reflection, Execution)
    └─ Agents (Primary Interface)
        ↓
BI Platform (Secondary)
    ├─ SDSL (Empirical Data)
    ├─ Model-View-Dashboard
    └─ Agents can use BI, but don't depend on it
```

**Advantage:** Agents are primary, BI is secondary

## Why This Matters

### 1. Agents Are Primary

**Our architecture:**
- Agents are the primary interface
- BI is a tool agents can use
- Agents can query data directly (via GDSL)
- Agents can generate insights (via Logic)

**Looker/Malloy:**
- BI is the primary interface
- Need to add agents
- Agents would be secondary
- More vulnerable to disruption

### 2. BI as Secondary Target

**Our approach:**
- BI uses "secondary empirical concepts"
- Measures, dimensions, aggregations
- Empirical data (observable, measurable)
- Secondary to primary AI operations

**This means:**
- BI is a subset of AI platform
- Not the whole platform
- Can be enhanced by AI capabilities
- Not competing with pure BI platforms

### 3. Entirely Agential

**Our future:**
- Everything goes through agents
- Agents orchestrate BI
- Agents can use BI or bypass it
- Agents are the primary interface

**Looker/Malloy:**
- BI is the primary interface
- Need to add agents
- Agents would be secondary
- More challenged by AI disruption

## Competitive Advantage

### We're Not Competing on BI Terms

**Looker/Malloy compete on:**
- Query performance
- Visualization quality
- Dashboard features
- Data modeling

**We compete on:**
- AI platform capabilities
- Agent orchestration
- Graph/ML operations
- Logical reasoning

**BI is just one capability** within our AI platform.

### Agents Challenge Looker/Malloy More

**Why:**
- AI agents can query data directly
- AI agents can generate visualizations
- AI agents can answer questions
- **Agents bypass traditional BI interfaces**

**Looker/Malloy response:**
- Need to add AI capabilities
- Need to integrate with agents
- Playing catch-up

**Our position:**
- Already built on AI platform
- Agents are primary
- BI is secondary
- **Less vulnerable to AI disruption**

## Architecture Implications

### Our BI is Different

**Not a pure BI platform:**
- BI is secondary target
- Embedded in AI platform
- Agents can use or bypass
- Leverages AI capabilities

**Malloy-Lite approach:**
- Query-oriented Views (Malloy-inspired)
- But within AI platform context
- Agents can orchestrate
- Not competing with Malloy directly

### Agent-First Architecture

**Everything goes through agents:**
```
Agent (Primary)
    ├─ Can use GDSL (Graph/ML)
    ├─ Can use Logic (Reasoning)
    └─ Can use BI (Empirical Data)
        ├─ Model-View-Dashboard
        └─ Malloy-Lite Views
```

**Agents orchestrate:**
- Graph operations (GDSL)
- Logical reasoning (Logic)
- BI queries (SDSL)
- All within one platform

## Strategic Positioning

### We're Not a BI Company

**We're an AI platform company:**
- AI platform is primary
- BI is secondary capability
- Agents are primary interface
- Graph/ML is core

**This means:**
- We don't compete with Looker/Malloy on BI
- We compete on AI platform capabilities
- BI is just one feature
- Agents are the differentiator

### Looker/Malloy Are More Vulnerable

**They're pure BI:**
- BI is their whole business
- Being disrupted by AI agents
- Need to add AI capabilities
- More challenged by AI

**We're AI-first:**
- AI platform is foundation
- BI is secondary
- Agents are primary
- Less vulnerable to disruption

## Conclusion

**Key Insights:**

1. **BI as Secondary**: We're not a pure BI platform - BI is secondary within AI platform
2. **Entirely Agential**: Agents are primary interface, BI is a tool agents can use
3. **Not Competing**: We don't compete with Looker/Malloy on BI terms
4. **More Vulnerable**: Looker/Malloy are more challenged by AI agents than we are

**Strategic Position:**
- AI platform company (not BI company)
- Agents are primary
- BI is secondary capability
- Less vulnerable to AI disruption

---

**Key Insight**: We're not competing with Looker/Malloy because we're an AI platform company with BI as a secondary capability. They're pure BI platforms being disrupted by AI agents. We're entirely agential - agents are primary, BI is secondary. They're more challenged by AI than we are.
