/**
 * Controller: The Universal/Axiomatic & Mediating Moment
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * In the dialectical architecture, a Controller is not just an imperative handler,
 * but the universal, generative, or axiomatic principle that governs the Model.
 * It is the moment of Concept, Mediation, and Inferenceâ€”applying universal laws
 * (from the @/logic Forms Engine) to particular Models, and mediating between
 * the noumenal (universal) and phenomenal (particular) layers of science.
 *
 * The Controller is the Syllogism or Inference engine: it applies dynamical rules
 * to kinematic beings, executes the Model, and predicts or infers future states.
 *
 * Architecturally, the Controller mediates between the logical forms and the
 * particular sciences, and lives to sublate itself into the Agent (via Workflow),
 * which is the terminal point of the dialectical process.
 *
 * This scaffold provides a generic Controller system, supporting:
 *   - Actions (operations, interventions, or commands)
 *   - Rules (policies, constraints, or generative axioms)
 *   - Formulae (universal principles or logic)
 *   - Mediation between logic and model, and sublation into Agent/Workflow
