## Major Breakthroughs Achieved

### 1. **TAW as Pure Nama (Naming Principle)**
- **Task-Agent-Workflow** as pure **Subjective Triadic Idea Plane**
- Independent of BEC‚ÜíMVC external complexities
- **Workflow as Organic Unity** containing Task:Agent Dyad
- No external Task-Agent relationship possible outside Workflow synthesis

### 2. **Schema-Centric GraphStore Architecture** 
- **Single Graph Schema** as **universal seed** for all projections
- Root schema projects into subschemas, subgraphs, workflows, tasks
- **GraphCatalog** = **Universal Set of Independent GraphStores**
- Complete schema isolation and operational independence

### 3. **NeoVM-GraphStore Association Pattern**
- **One NeoVM instance ‚Üî One GraphStore** relationship
- **AI-generated NativeProjections** optimized for each GraphStore
- **NeoVM-TaskD as standalone shell** managing multiple NeoVM instances
- Scalable architecture supporting growing NeoVM fleet

### 4. **Graph Data Science Evolution**
- **Task projects as Graph** (Being-Model = Task-Graph)
- **Agent stored as Schemas in FormDB** (projects to drive workflows)
- **HugeGraph as Union of Projections** research platform
