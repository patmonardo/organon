# NEOVM-TASKD Architecture

## Pure TAW (Task-Agent-Workflow) as Subjective Triadic Idea Plane

### Core Insight
**TAW as Pure Nama (Name)** - the conceptual naming principle that structures reality itself. Everything objective re-emerges from the dyadic objective plane into what for us is **Idea as Subjective Triadic idea plane**.

### TAW Systematic Architecture

#### Task (T)
- **Pure immediacy** of purpose and execution
- **Being-Model synthesis** - immediate presence with abstract representation
- **Concrete instantiation** of systematic purpose

#### Agent (A) 
- **Reflective mediation** and constructive power
- **Essence-View synthesis** - reflective capability with perspectival interpretation
- **Synthetic constructor** providing mediation between Task and Workflow

#### Workflow (W)
- **Systematic unity** and orchestration
- **Concept-Controller synthesis** - conceptual organization with material coordination
- **Organic totality** containing Task-Agent dialectical development

### Platform Architecture

#### NestJS Foundation
- **Dependency injection** for systematic service architecture
- **Modular organization** reflecting TAW systematic structure
- **Decorators and metadata** for declarative systematic programming

#### Genkit Integration
- **AI workflow orchestration** for systematic intelligence
- **Multi-step AI processes** embodying Agent synthetic construction
- **Flow coordination** expressing Workflow systematic unity

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Pure TAW Classes** - Clean Task, Agent, Workflow implementations
2. **Systematic Schemas** - Zod validation expressing TAW logical structure  
3. **NestJS Services** - Service layer embodying TAW systematic architecture
4. **Genkit Workflows** - AI orchestration expressing systematic intelligence
5. **Repository Pattern** - Data persistence maintaining TAW systematic integrity

### Development Focus

- **Master NestJS/Genkit platform** for systematic TAW implementation
- **Clean separation** from FormDB BECâ†’MVC concerns
- **Pure TAW essence** as naming principle structuring computational reality
- **Systematic correspondence** between philosophical insight and running code

This is **neovm-taskd** as pure computational embodiment of TAW systematic architecture.
