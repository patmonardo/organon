# Multi-User Projection Architecture Analysis

## Core Problem Statement

**How does a single NeoVM instance support Multi-User Projection where multiple users contribute Tasks to a Union Graph that feeds Agent Projection as separate schemas/ontologies?**

## Architectural Challenges

### 1. Single NeoVM → Multi-User Projection
```
Single NeoVM Instance
├── Must handle multiple user contexts simultaneously
├── Each user projects Tasks into shared infrastructure  
├── Maintain user isolation while enabling collaboration
└── Support concurrent projection operations
```

### 2. HugeGraph as Union of Tasks
```
HugeGraph (Shared Infrastructure)
├── Union of Tasks from User 1, User 2, ..., User n
├── Task aggregation and merging mechanisms
├── Conflict resolution for overlapping Tasks
└── Unified graph structure for Agent processing
```

### 3. Agent Projection Target Architecture
**Key Decision Point**: What is the Agent Projection target?

#### Option A: Separate Graph
```
Agent Projection → Separate Graph
├── Distinct graph structure for Agent processing
├── Agent-specific nodes and relationships
├── Separate from Task Union Graph
└── Agent operations isolated from Task operations
```

#### Option B: Schema/Ontology/Axiology Arrays
```
Agent Projection → Array Collections
├── Schemas: Structural definitions array
├── Ontologies: Conceptual knowledge array  
├── Axiologies: Value systems array
└── Array-based processing vs graph processing
```

## Multi-User Projection Mechanisms

### User Context Management
```typescript
interface UserProjectionContext {
  userId: string;
  userTasks: TaskAbsolute[];
  projectionScope: ProjectionScope;
  isolationLevel: 'strict' | 'collaborative' | 'shared';
  taskContributions: TaskContribution[];
}

interface MultiUserProjectionEngine {
  // Handle multiple user contexts
  projectMultiUser(
    contexts: UserProjectionContext[]
  ): Promise<MultiUserProjectionResult>;
  
  // Aggregate user Tasks into Union Graph
  createTaskUnion(
    userTasks: Map<string, TaskAbsolute[]>
  ): Promise<UnionGraph>;
  
  // Project Union into Agent processing
  projectUnionToAgent(
    taskUnion: UnionGraph
  ): Promise<AgentProjection>;
}
```

### Task Union Aggregation
```typescript
interface TaskUnionStrategy {
  // How do we merge Tasks from multiple users?
  aggregationType: 'merge' | 'separate' | 'hierarchical';
  
  // Conflict resolution
  conflictResolution: {
    overlappingTasks: 'merge' | 'isolate' | 'version';
    namingConflicts: 'namespace' | 'rename' | 'error';
    dependencyConflicts: 'resolve' | 'isolate' | 'error';
  };
  
  // User boundary preservation
  userBoundaries: {
    maintainOwnership: boolean;
    enableCrossUserDependencies: boolean;
    sharedResourceAccess: 'readonly' | 'readwrite' | 'isolated';
  };
}
```

## Agent Projection Architecture Options

### Option A: Agent as Separate Graph
```typescript
interface AgentGraphProjection {
  // Agent operates on separate graph structure
  agentGraph: {
    nodes: AgentNode[];           // Agent-specific nodes
    edges: AgentRelationship[];   // Agent-specific relationships
    operations: AgentOperation[]; // Agent processing operations
  };
  
  // Connection to Task Union Graph
  taskUnionInterface: {
    readTaskUnion: () => UnionGraph;
    processTaskUnion: (union: UnionGraph) => AgentResult;
    updateFromTaskChanges: (changes: TaskChange[]) => void;
  };
}
```

### Option B: Agent as Schema/Ontology Arrays
```typescript
interface AgentSchemaArrayProjection {
  // Agent operates on array-based structures
  schemas: SchemaDefinition[];      // Structural definitions
  ontologies: OntologyDefinition[]; // Conceptual knowledge  
  axiologies: AxiologyDefinition[]; // Value systems
  
  // Processing mechanisms
  schemaProcessing: {
    validateTaskUnion: (union: UnionGraph) => ValidationResult;
    extractStructures: (union: UnionGraph) => SchemaDefinition[];
    synthesizeKnowledge: (schemas: SchemaDefinition[]) => OntologyDefinition[];
  };
}
```

## Multi-User Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: User Isolation with Shared Union
```
User 1 Tasks → Isolated Projection → Task Union Graph ← Isolated Projection ← User 2 Tasks
                                           ↓
                                   Agent Projection
                                (Processes unified Task Union)
```

### Pattern 2: Collaborative Task Space
```
User 1 Tasks ↘
              → Collaborative Task Space → Agent Projection
User 2 Tasks ↗
```

### Pattern 3: Hierarchical User Organization
```
Organization Root
├── Department 1 (User Group A)
│   ├── User 1 Tasks → Department Task Union
│   └── User 2 Tasks → Department Task Union
├── Department 2 (User Group B)
│   ├── User 3 Tasks → Department Task Union
│   └── User 4 Tasks → Department Task Union
└── Organization Task Union → Agent Projection
```

## Implementation Questions

### Technical Architecture
1. **How does NeoVM handle concurrent user projections?**
2. **What is the Task Union merge algorithm?**
3. **How do we maintain user isolation while enabling collaboration?**
4. **What is the optimal Agent Projection target (Graph vs Arrays)?**

### Projection Mechanisms
1. **How do multiple user Tasks project into single Union Graph?**
2. **What happens when user Tasks have dependencies on other users' Tasks?**
3. **How do Agent Projections handle multi-user Task complexity?**
4. **What is the update/synchronization mechanism for Task Union changes?**

### User Experience
1. **How do users see their contributions in the Union Graph?**
2. **What visibility do users have into other users' Tasks?**
3. **How do collaborative workflows get coordinated?**
4. **What are the permission and access control mechanisms?**

## Research Priorities

1. **Multi-User Projection Engine Design** - Core mechanism for handling multiple users
2. **Task Union Algorithm** - How to aggregate user Tasks effectively
3. **Agent Projection Target Decision** - Graph vs Schema Arrays
4. **User Isolation vs Collaboration Balance** - Optimal sharing mechanisms
5. **Concurrency and Synchronization** - Multi-user coordination patterns

## Success Criteria

- Single NeoVM supports multiple users simultaneously
- Clean Task Union aggregation from multiple user projections
- Effective Agent Projection processing of multi-user Task Unions
- User isolation maintained while enabling necessary collaboration
- Scalable architecture for growing user base
- Clear separation of user contributions while enabling system-wide synthesis
