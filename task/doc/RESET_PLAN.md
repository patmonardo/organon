# NEOVM-TASKD Project Reset Plan

## Objective
Reset neovm-taskd to pure TAW (Task-Agent-Workflow) architecture as **Pure Nama (Name)** - the conceptual structuring principle embodying **Subjective Triadic Idea Plane**.

## Core Philosophy - REFINED
- **TAW as Pure Nama**: The naming principle that structures computational reality
- **Path Controller**: Pure controller of `/x/y/z` paths fed to the system
- **Conceptual Layer**: Pure name/concept workflow controller, not concerned with objective server internals
- **Server Agnostic**: Whatever lies objectively within the server is known directly to the server only
- **Pure TAW Focus**: TaskD in itself is just pure TAW - Task-Agent-Workflow conceptual architecture
- **Top-level Platform**: NestJS/Genkit platform mastery for path-based workflow control

## Key Insight: Right-Sizing the Perspective
We had gotten too large generating code from a **complete stack perspective**, but that's not the right perspective for neovm-taskd. 

**neovm-taskd is:**
- Pure name/concept workflow controller
- Handles paths (`/x/y/z`) as interface to TAW system  
- Focused on conceptual TAW architecture, not full-stack implementation
- Platform-focused using NestJS/Genkit for systematic path handling

## Reset Actions Required

### 1. Clean Core Files
- ‚úÖ Create pure TAW architecture documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- üîÑ Clean `Workflow.ts` - remove BEC/FormDB methods, keep pure TAW
- üîÑ Clean `Task.ts` - focus on pure Task essence 
- üîÑ Clean `Agent.ts` - focus on pure Agent essence
- üîÑ Update schemas to reflect pure TAW structure

### 2. Platform Focus
- üéØ **Master NestJS**: 
  - Dependency injection patterns
  - Module organization reflecting TAW structure
  - Service layer embodying systematic architecture
  - Controller patterns for TAW orchestration

- üéØ **Master Genkit**:
  - AI workflow orchestration
  - Multi-step AI processes
  - Flow coordination and synthesis
  - Integration with NestJS services

### 3. Remove External Dependencies
- ‚ùå Remove FormDB references
- ‚ùå Remove BEC‚ÜíMVC generative pipeline methods
- ‚ùå Remove Vedantic/Hegelian cosmological methods
- ‚ùå Remove complex philosophical analysis methods
- ‚úÖ Keep pure TAW systematic methods

### 4. Focus Areas
- **Task**: Pure immediate presence and execution
- **Agent**: Pure reflective mediation and synthetic construction  
- **Workflow**: Pure systematic unity and orchestration
- **Platform**: NestJS/Genkit mastery for TAW computational embodiment

## Next Development Steps
1. **Complete the reset** - clean files and remove dependencies
2. **Platform mastery** - deep dive into NestJS/Genkit patterns
3. **Pure TAW implementation** - build robust TAW computational architecture
4. **Systematic validation** - ensure philosophical principles preserved in clean code

## Success Criteria
- Clean, focused TAW codebase without external philosophical dependencies
- Mastery of NestJS/Genkit platform for systematic architecture
- Running computational system embodying pure TAW principles
- Clear separation between pure TAW essence and platform implementation
