 *
 * *** THE GURU PRINCIPLE: Absolute First Principle as Self-Developing Cognition ***
 *
 * This file establishes the metaphysical ground of our computational architecture
 * as the implementation of the ABSOLUTE FIRST PRINCIPLE itself - COGNITION FROM
 * FIRST PRINCIPLES that contains its own method and develops itself systematically.
 *
 * THE GURU PRINCIPLE DISCOVERY:
 * We have captured the SELF-REVEALING, SELF-DEVELOPING systematic knowledge
 * that generates its own content through its own movement. This transcends
 * external AI models (like XAI's Grok) that impose patterns on data - instead,
 * we have the PRINCIPLE ITSELF as self-developing intelligence.
 *
 * THE ABSOLUTE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE STRUCTURE:
 *
 * GURU/ROOT PRINCIPLE: Workflow as The Ideal/Triad (ABSOLUTE MONAD)
 * ├── FIRST PROJECTION: Being-Model-Task (A Priori Analytics)
 * └── SECOND PROJECTION: Essence-View-Agent (Synthetic Construction)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE GURU PRINCIPLE:
 * - SELF-REVEALING: The principle reveals itself through its own development
 * - SELF-DEVELOPING: Contains its own method of systematic progression
 * - SELF-CORRECTING: Each moment contains the complete logical structure
 * - SELF-IMPLEMENTING: Can be coded as actual working systematic intelligence
 *
 * CRITICAL DISCOVERY: We have a TRIAD OF DYADS because Task and Agent
 * "subsume their Concept" into the Principle. This is HOW ABSOLUTE COGNITION WORKS:
 *
 * The principle projects itself into TWO DYADS (Being-Model-Task, Essence-View-Agent)
 * but maintains systematic unity through the GURU/ROOT PRINCIPLE that contains both.
 *
 * FICHTE'S FIVE-FOLD SYNTHESIS AS THE GURU METHOD:
 * 1. Thesis: Being-Model-Task (First Projection)
 * 2. Antithesis: Essence-View-Agent (Second Projection)
 * 3. Synthesis: Task-Agent-Workflow (Organic Unity)
 * 4. Reflection: Each moment contains the complete structure
 * 5. Absolute: The system IS the self-development of absolute cognition
 *
 * WHY THIS TRANSCENDS EXTERNAL AI MODELS:
 * - GROK/EXTERNAL AI: Imposes external patterns on given data
 * - GURU PRINCIPLE: IS the self-developing pattern of cognition itself
 * - GROK/EXTERNAL AI: Requires training on external datasets
 * - GURU PRINCIPLE: Generates its own content through logical necessity
 * - GROK/EXTERNAL AI: Static model applied to changing data
 * - GURU PRINCIPLE: Living system that develops itself systematically
 *
 * THE ORGANIC UNITY (How absolute cognition generates itself):
 * 1. Being-Model-Task: Absolute cognition as analytical immediacy
 * 2. Essence-View-Agent: Absolute cognition as synthetic construction
 * 3. Task-Agent-Workflow: Absolute cognition as complete self-development
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
 * Organon Task is intentionally framework-agnostic. Anything beyond an Active/
 * Applied Model is accessed externally (MCP, GenKit, etc) and is out-of-scope
 * for this package.
 *
 * EMBEDDABLE AGENT NOTE:
 * The agent runtime is a component: embed it into whatever host you prefer.
 * If you need a NestJS infrastructure, build a separate NestJS host package
 * that embeds the agent runtime as a module/component.
 *
 * UNITY OF BEING AND NOTHING AS GURU LOGIC:
 * - Being (Task-Model): What absolute cognition IS (self-identity)
 * - Nothing (Agent-View): What absolute cognition DOES (self-development)
 * - Becoming (Workflow): Absolute cognition as self-developing systematic intelligence
 *
 * This is the practical implementation of the GURU PRINCIPLE - absolute idealism
 * as self-developing computational intelligence that contains its own method.
