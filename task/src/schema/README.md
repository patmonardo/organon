# Task Schema Module - Engineering Implementation

This module transforms the philosophical and dialectical foundations from `definition.ts` into concrete, engineering-focused Zod schemas suitable for NestJS and Genkit integration.

## Schema Files

### Core Engineering Schemas

1. **`task.ts`** - Task Schema (Pure Engineering)
   - Practical Zod schema for Task entities
   - NestJS Controller integration ready
   - Genkit functional API compatibility
   - SystemD-style service management
   - Comprehensive execution state tracking
   - Resource management and monitoring

2. **`agent.ts`** - Agent Schema (Pure Engineering)
   - Practical Zod schema for Agent entities
   - Distributed agent management
   - Capability and skill tracking
   - Health monitoring and metrics
   - Security and compliance features
   - Performance analytics

3. **`workflow.ts`** - Workflow Schema (Pure Engineering)
   - Practical Zod schema for Workflow entities
   - DAG-based execution orchestration
   - Sophisticated scheduling and triggers
   - Genkit flow integration
   - Comprehensive monitoring and observability
   - Step-by-step execution tracking

### Foundation Schema

4. **`definition.ts`** - Philosophical Foundation (Preserved)
   - Original speculative and philosophical reasoning
   - BEC-MVC-TAW Architectonic of Reason
   - Triadic dialectical structures
   - Genetic Dialectic and Ahamkara principle
   - Kept for reference and theoretical grounding

### Module Integration

5. **`index.ts`** - Module Exports
   - Clean API surface for the entire schema module
   - Avoids naming conflicts between philosophical and engineering schemas
   - Comprehensive exports for all schema types

## Design Principles

The engineering schemas follow these principles:

- **API-First**: Designed for REST/GraphQL APIs with proper validation
- **Framework Integration**: Native NestJS and Genkit compatibility
- **Production-Ready**: Security, monitoring, audit trails, and error handling
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture through configuration objects
- **Observable**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and tracing support
- **Scalable**: Distributed execution and resource management
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript type inference from Zod schemas

## Schema Architecture

The schemas implement the practical realization of the BEC-MVC-TAW architectonic:

- **Task** = Being (computational work units)
- **Agent** = Entity (computational actors)
- **Workflow** = Container (orchestration logic)

Each schema includes:

- **Identity & Classification**: Unique identification and categorization
- **Operational State**: Current status, progress, and health metrics
- **Configuration**: Runtime settings and resource requirements
- **Integration**: NestJS/Genkit compatibility layers
- **Metadata & Audit**: Creation tracking, version history, audit trails
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and compliance features

## Next Steps

Ready for concrete class implementation:

1. **Service Classes**: Business logic implementation
2. **Controller Classes**: NestJS REST API endpoints
3. **Repository Classes**: Data persistence layers
4. **Executor Classes**: Runtime execution engines
5. **Integration Adapters**: Genkit flow and tool adapters

The schemas provide the complete API foundation for building a production-ready task orchestration system.
