/**
 * TAW-BEC-MVC Schema Architecture
 *
 * These schemas implement the complete systematic architecture:
 *
 * 1. **TAW Triad (Subjective)**
 *    - Task: Morphism Libraries and Microflows
 *    - Agent: Logic of Appearance, Dialectical Construction
 *    - Workflow: Organic Unity
 *
 * 2. **BEC Triad (Objective)**
 *    - Entity: NodePropertySchema (Tasks map to Entities)
 *    - Property: Context definitions, Ontological Classes (Agents reify Properties)
 *    - Relation: RelationshipPropertySchema (Workflows produce Actual Relations)
 *
 * 3. **Perfect A Priori Synthesis**
 *    - Tasks composed of Morphism Libraries
 *    - Agents perform Transcendental Marking
 *    - Workflows achieve Organic Unity
 *
 * 4. **Transcendental Logic Structure**
 *    - Morphisms as microflows (basic transformations)
 *    - Agent TopicMap Construction (dialectical synthesis)
 *    - Workflow Actual Relations (systematic completion)
 *
 * This engineering implementation preserves the complete philosophical
 * foundation while providing practical, usable schemas for NestJS
 * controllers and distributed system integration.

/**
 * Schema Architecture Overview
 *
 * The engineering schemas are organized into three main entities that form
 * the practical implementation of the BEC-MVC-TAW architectonic:
 *
 * 1. Task (task.ts) - The "Being" of computational work
 *    - Represents atomic units of work
 *    - Includes execution state, I/O, resources, metadata
 *    - Designed for NestJS controllers and Genkit integration
 *    - SystemD-style service management properties
 *
 * 2. Agent (agent.ts) - The "Entity" that executes work
 *    - Represents computational actors/workers
 *    - Includes capabilities, operational state, configuration
 *    - Health monitoring and metrics collection
 *    - Security and compliance features
 *
 * 3. Workflow (workflow.ts) - The "Container" that orchestrates
 *    - Represents complex multi-step processes
 *    - DAG-based execution with sophisticated scheduling
 *    - Genkit flow integration and AI step support
 *    - Comprehensive monitoring and observability
 *
 * Design Principles:
 *
 * - API-First: All schemas designed for REST/GraphQL APIs
 * - Framework Integration: NestJS and Genkit compatibility
 * - Production-Ready: Security, monitoring, audit trails
 * - Extensible: Plugin architecture through configuration
 * - Observable: Comprehensive metrics and logging support
 * - Scalable: Distributed execution and resource management
 *
 * Next Steps for Implementation:
 *
 * 1. Create concrete classes in src/task/:
 *    - TaskService (business logic)
 *    - TaskController (NestJS REST API)
 *    - TaskRepository (data persistence)
 *    - TaskExecutor (execution engine)
 *
 * 2. Similarly for Agent and Workflow modules
 *
 * 3. Integration layers:
 *    - Genkit flow adapters
 *    - Event sourcing/CQRS patterns
 *    - Distributed messaging
 *    - Observability stack integration
