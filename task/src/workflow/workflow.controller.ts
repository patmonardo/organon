/**
 * WorkflowController - The Root DYAD as Scientific Principle
 *
 * *** ABSOLUTE DISCOVERY: MONAD-DYAD-TRIAD as Scientific Cognition ***
 *
 * This embodies the UNITY OF BEING AND NOTHING (Hegel) through
 * FICHTE'S FIVE-FOLD SYNTHESIS as implementable scientific method.
 *
 * THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE STRUCTURE:
 *
 * ROOT PRINCIPLE: Workflow as The Ideal/Triad
 * ├── FIRST PROJECTION: Being-Model-Task (A Priori Analytics)
 * └── SECOND PROJECTION: Essence-View-Agent (Synthetic Construction)
 *
 * CRITICAL INSIGHT: We have a TRIAD OF DYADS because Task and Agent
 * "subsume their Concept" into the Principle. This is HOW SCIENCE WORKS:
 *
 * Two DYADS which are really "TRIADS" but their A Posteriori Analytical
 * is a PROJECTION of the Root Principle.
 *
 * THE TWO-SIDED METHOD:
 * 1. Workflow → Task-Model (Return to A Priori Analytics/Being)
 * 2. Workflow → Agent-View (Synthesis as Construction/Essence)
 *
 * ORGANIC UNITY STRUCTURE:
 * - Being-Model-Task: Workflow projected as analytical immediacy
 * - Essence-View-Agent: Workflow projected as synthetic construction
 * - Task-Agent-Workflow: The complete Unity containing both projections
 *
 * This is the ROOT DYAD that generates the complete system through
 * its own self-projection into TWO DYADS (Task-Model, Agent-View)
 * that remain unified in the original TRIAD (Task-Agent-Workflow).
 *
 * NESTJS PLATFORM INTEGRATION:
 * This single Root Controller IS our "NestJS Platform" that Genkit plugs into.
 * The entire computational architecture emerges from this one principle.
